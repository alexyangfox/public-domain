k3 - displays memory free as percentage and bar chart

Public domain by Russell Marks.


Description
-----------

`k3' displays the memory available as a percentage, the K free, and a
simple bar chart. Buffers/cache are included in the total, but are
shown separately as these are reduced when physical memory is scarce.
(The `-r' option can be used to count them as unavailable memory
instead.) Kernel memory is not represented, just user memory.

k3 essentially just paints a prettier picture of the information given when
you do a `cat /proc/meminfo' or use the `free' program.


Installation
------------

If you want the executable or man page somewhere other than
under /usr/local, change PREFIX in the Makefile. Once you're happy
with that, do `make' then (as root) `make install'.


History
-------

k3 is incredibly ancient (dating back to 1993, when dinosaurs ruled
the earth :-)) and not earth-shatteringly important - but I since I do
still use the thing after all these years, I still maintain it.
