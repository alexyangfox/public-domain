* Changes between versions   -*- mode:indented-text; mode:outline-minor -*-

This file (NEWS) documents the significant changes between all
versions of k3 since 1.4, with the newest changes first.


* Changes in k3 1.5

Should now cope with more than 2GB of RAM or swap (which it wouldn't
have done previously on 32-bit machines).

The output layout should now be ok up to just under 96GB.


* Changes in k3 1.4

Now copes with `new' format /proc/meminfo, with separate `cached'
listing. Before this change it would almost always have looked like
memory was full.
