	* Version 1.5.

	* k3.c: changed layout so displayed RAM/swap can get to just under
	96 gigs without messing it up. :-)
	(readmeminfo_new): now reads info using the `new' fields, so it
	should correctly cope with >=2GB of RAM or swap on a 32-bit
	machine. It resorts to the old method if those fields can't be
	read.

	* Version 1.4.

	* Now copes with `new' format /proc/meminfo, with separate
	`cached' listing. Before this change it would almost always have
	looked like memory was full.
