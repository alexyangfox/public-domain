$FG,5$These take a pointer to a bit field.$FG$
$WW,1$$FG,2$Bt$FG$:	Bit Test
$FG,2$Bts$FG$:	Bit Test and Set to one
$FG,2$Btr$FG$:	Bit Test and Rst to zero
$FG,2$Btc$FG$:	Bit Test and Compliment (toggle)
$FG,2$BEqu$FG$:	Set bit to value.

$FG$$FG,5$Bit operations are "atomic" meaning they won't be interrupted between the testing of the bit and the alteration.This is important when multitasking.With multiprocessing, you should "Lock" these operations.$FG$

$FG,5$These don't take a pointer, but the actual field.$FG$
$FG,2$Bsf$FG$:	Bit Scan Fwd (Pos of first low one bit or -1)
$FG,2$Bsr$FG$:	Bit Scan Reverse (Pos of first high one bit or -1)
$FG,2$BCnt$FG$:	Bit Cnt (Cnt of set bits)
