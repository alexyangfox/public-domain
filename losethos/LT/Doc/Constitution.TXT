$FG,5$$WW,1$$TX+CX,"LoseThos Constitution"$$FG$

The goal of LoseThos is to provide an ideal environment for recreational programming and not imitate $FG,2$Linux$FG$.LoseThos is orders of magnitude simpler than $FG,2$Linux$FG$ to better fulfill the promise of $FG,2$open source$FG$.The vision for LoseThos is a 64-bit, souped-up, multitasking, multicore $FG,2$Commodore 64$FG$ with a $FG,2$C+$FG$ shell instead of $FG,2$BASIC$FG$ that runs $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"x86_64","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd64#AMD64"$$FG$  code.

LoseThos holds no standards sacred -- everything is freshly designed from scratch.This is not a 1970's main frame operating system and, no, it has nothing to do with $FG,2$Commodore 64$FG$ emulation -- it's $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"x86_64","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd64#AMD64"$$FG$.

 
1) LoseThos is $FG,2$ring-0-only$FG$, running everything in kernel mode including applications.You have full access to memory, I/O ports, instructions, etc. at all times, because that's fun.

2) LoseThos will always $FG,2$identity-map$FG$ memory in a $FG,2$single-address-map$FG$ configuration.(Virtual addresses are always kept equal to physical addresses with a single map for all tasks on all cores.)It's as though paging is not used.

3) LoseThos will always be for one platform -- $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"x86_64","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd64#AMD64"$$FG$ PC compatibles.

4) LoseThos will never have networking, so malware is less of an issue.

5) LoseThos will always have one video mode, $FG,2$640x480$FG$ by 16 colors, unless that mode becomes unavailable on computers in the future.

6) The LoseThos operating system will always be $FG,2$free$FG$.I might sell applications, support, or, possibly, do adware.

7) LoseThos will always be $FG,2$100% open source$FG$ with all source included, unless device drivers or something can only be included with non-disclosure agreements.

8) All function args and returns will be 64-bit.No plans for C++.

9) LoseThos documents are not for printing.They're dynamic and intended for the screen.There will always be just one font, a fixed-width font.No Unicode, just ASCII.

10) LoseThos is not for multimedia.Games will be created by programmers, not artists.Sounds and images will be, primarily, calculated in real-time, not fetched.

11) All functions, variables and class members will be accessible.There are no C++ $FG,2$public$FG$/$FG,2$private$FG$ protections and all functions, even secondary ones in the kernel, can be called.

12) $FG,4$$BK,1$Backward compatibility is NOT guaranteed.$FG$$BK,0$You are safest working with $FG,2$JIT$FG$ compilation instead of $FG,2$AOT$FG$ static binaries because I can add members to classes, reorder members in classes, add default args to existing functions, change $FG,2$#define$FG$ values, etc. all without breaking compatibility.
