$WW,1$LoseThos uses a 64-bit value, $LK,"LTDate","MN:LTDate"$, for date/time.The upper 32-bits are the days since Christ.The lower 32-bits store time of day divided by 4 billion which works out to 49710ths of a second.You can subtract two $LK,"LTDate","MN:LTDate"$'s to get a time span.

Use $LK,"LTDATE_FREQ","MN:LTDATE_FREQ"$ to convert.
