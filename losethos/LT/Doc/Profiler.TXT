$WW,1$The LoseThos profiler records statistics on what code location was executing when a task was preempted.You can learn where most time is wasted.There are two modes, $LK,"ProfBin","MN:ProfBin"$() which monitors a range of buckets and $LK,"ProfAll","MN:ProfAll"$() which records a hit location as well as count.I recommend $LK,"ProfAll","MN:ProfAll"$().

You can pass a subroutine depth level argument which records a hit in not only the routine executing, but the routines which called it, as well.

When done collecting statistics, use $LK,"ProfRep","MN:ProfRep"$() for a report.You might need a $LK,"LtfMax","MN:LtfMax"$() to expand the command line window buffer to fit it all.

You can set the CPU to monitor with $LK,"ProfCPUSet","MN:ProfCPUSet"$().

Study the code.The profiler is very simple and you might want to enhance it or modify it to debug something in particular.
