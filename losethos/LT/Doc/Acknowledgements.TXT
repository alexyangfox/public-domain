$WW,1$$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Acknowledgements"$$FG$

I am a for profit company, not an academic.I have never seen a commercial product with acknowledgements like an academic paper.Never-the-less, here are references.(I don't know the original sources on many of these.)

1) The font, $LK,"::/LT/OSMain/Font8x8.CPZ","FI:::/LT/OSMain/Font8x8.CPZ"$, is taken from $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"FreeDOS","http://www.freedos.org"$$FG$.

2) $LK,"::/LT/OSMain/Dsk/ATADef.HPZ","FI:::/LT/OSMain/Dsk/ATADef.HPZ"$ originally
from Linux.I later got the spec.

3) The heap algorithm, $LK,"::/LT/OSMain/Memory.CPZ","FI:::/LT/OSMain/Memory.CPZ"$, is adapted from one I saw at Ticketmaster when I worked on their VAX operating system.

4) The LZW compression algorithm, $LK,"::/LT/OSMain/Compress.CPZ","FI:::/LT/OSMain/Compress.CPZ"$, came from a magazine and I implemented it when I worked for Ticketmaster.

5) The adaptive-step-size-Runge-Kutta algorithm, $LK,"::/LT/Adam/MathOde.APZ","FI:::/LT/Adam/MathOde.APZ"$, is adapted from the book, $UL,1$Numeric Recipies in C$UL,0$.

6) The random number generator is from the book, $UL,1$Numeric Recipies in C$UL,0$.

7) The pilgrim game map is from $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"US Geological Survey","http://nationalatlas.gov/mapmaker"$$FG$.(Screen captured and edited with MS Paint and saved as $FG,2$.BMP$FG$ and imported into LoseThos and converted with a program I wrote.)

8) Tne sheep in AfterEgypt is from $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"http://www.public-domain-photos.com","http://www.public-domain-photos.com"$$FG$.

9) The $FG,2$FAT32$FG$ file system is owned by MicroSoft.

10) A few features were inspired by $FG,2$MATLAB$FG$, such as $FG,2$ans$FG$ in expressions at the command-line.There is a lot of $FG,2$MSDOS$FG$ , $FG,2$Windows$FG$, $FG,2$VAXTMOS$FG$ (VAX Ticketmaster O.S.) and $FG,2$Unix$FG$ inspiration, too, such as drive letters, command names, etc.

11) I included $LK+HTML,"PCIDevice List File","FI:::/LT/Misc/PCIDevices.TXZ","http://www.pcidatabase.com/reports.php?type=tab-delimeted"$ and $LK+HTML,"The King James Bible","FI:::/LT/Misc/Bible.TXZ","http://promo.net/pg/"$.

12) Thanks to whoever wrote this $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"CppHtml.CPP","http://web.archive.org/web/20100325153025/http://home.scarlet.be/zoetrope/cpphtml.htm"$$FG$.I'm a novice on web stuff and you helped me with html.See $LK,"ToHtml","FI:::/LT/Adam/ToHtml.APZ"$.

13) Yahoo Sitebuilder helped with some html code items.

14) I used $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"MagicISO","http://www.magiciso.com"$$FG$ to burn test CD's to help me understand the ISO9660 file system format.I mostly used the $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"ISO9660","http://users.telenet.be/it3.consultants.bvba/handouts/ISO9960.html"$$FG$ spec.

15) I looked at bootable CD boot sects, but didn't learn anything, finding it easier to make my own.

16) I think I got my original PC speaker code from $FG,2$Borland C$FG$.

17) I found PS/2 keyboard and mouse code on the net and documentation.My code is very different.I found VGA register info on the net.

18) Thanks to $FG,4$$TX+HTML,"http://www.osdev.net","http://www.osdev.net"$$FG$ for a couple tips.

19) God told me to stick with 640x480x16 color and kept me from blindly making child windows like $FG,2$Windows$FG$.Instead, I made one window per task with no child windows.He also guided my progress, very obviously.

In short, I wrote every one of the $TX+D,"129,739","DOC_LOSETHOS_LOC"$ lines myself, no $FG,2$GPL$FG$ code, no linkage or dependence on other code.Anyone who says otherwise is being an ass.
