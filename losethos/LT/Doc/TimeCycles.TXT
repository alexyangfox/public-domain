$WW,1$Intel has an instruction that returns the num of CPU cycles since boot.This is not calibrated to an accurate real time value, but LoseThos measures it and you can convert with $LK,"time_stamp_freq","MN:time_stamp_freq"$, a value continuously calibrated from other timers.This is the fastest timer available.
