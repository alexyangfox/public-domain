$WW,1$There are sym(hash) tables maintained by each task.When a sym is not found, the parent task's sym table is checked.All process chain back to the $FG,2$Adam$FG$ task.

LoseThos sym tables are implemented with an array of linked-lists.A num is generated from a string to index into it.Since multiple strings could generate the same num, a linked-list is built.Usually, newer entries overshadow older ones unless otherwise specified, in which case old entries are removed.There are various types of entries.See $LK,"Hash Entry Types","MN:HTT_EXPORT_SYS_SYM"$.
