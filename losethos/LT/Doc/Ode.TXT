$WW,1$LoseThos has an advanced algorithm for integrating ordinary differential equations suitable for use in video games.(Not scientific work.)It also has some support for systems of masses and springs, to save you some work.

See $LK,"Ode","MN:Ode"$ and $LK,"OdesUpdate","MN:OdesUpdate"$ for an overview.
See $LK,"OdeCallDerivative","MN:OdeCallDerivative"$ to see what support there is for masses and springs.
