$WW,1$The $FG,2$LTZ$FG$ utility is on the $LK,"registered version","FI:::/LT/Doc/Registered.TXZ"$.

$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Linux LTZ Utility"$$FG$


$FG,2$LTZ [-ascii] filename$FG$

Will uncompress a single file from Linux.The $FG,2$-ascii$FG$ flag will convert the irregular LoseThos ASCII 5 and ASCII 31 characters to spaces.(ASCII 5 is used to mark the cursor pos and ASCII 31 is used for shifted space characters and will cause problems unless you convert them.)


$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Windows LTZ Utility"$$FG$

$FG,2$LTZ$FG$ is a Windows cmd line program which will assist transferring files from LoseThos to Windows.It will also uncompress LoseThos files you have gotten to Windows.There are three ways to get files from LoseThos to Windows -- via CD-ROM, a $FG,2$FAT32$FG$ partition or via a "file partition" you have created with $FG,2$LTZ$FG$ on a Windows partition.


$FG,2$LTZ -expand [-ascii] dirname$FG$:

will uncompress all LoseThos files with names ending in '$FG,2$Z$FG$' in a Windows directory and in all subdirectories.The $FG,2$-ascii$FG$ flag used in combination will convert the irregular LoseThos ASCII 5 and ASCII 31 characters to spaces.(ASCII 5 is used to mark the cursor pos and ASCII 31 is used for shifted space characters and will cause problems unless you convert them.)Note: If you pick names not ending in '$FG,2$Z$FG$', they will not need to be uncompressed.You can $LK,"Move","MN:Move"$() or $LK,"Copy","MN:Copy"$() them to a name not ending in '$FG,2$Z$FG$' and they will be stored uncompressed.


$FG,2$LTZ -make megcnt partitionfilename signnum$FG$:

will create a file on a Windows partition and fill it with a signature num that can be searched for block-by-block from LoseThos.Once some blocks have been allocated by Windows and located by LoseThos, and if you don't mess with them, you can use them to transfer files between LoseThos and Windows.This is a little risky.It's pretty safe if you create this file on a partition dedicated for this purpose.


$LK,"NonLTScan","MN:NonLTScan"$():

is a LoseThos cmd which will scan for some blocks created by $FG,2$LTZ$FG$ and provide a block num you can use to specify a "Non-LT file partition".You can recompile OSMain and define this partition or use $LK,"Mount","MN:Mount"$() each time.You will be asked to provide a drive letter and from then on, you just copy files to that partition, boot Windows and run $FG,2$LTZ$FG$ to extract them.


$FG,2$LTZ -extract dstdirname partitionfilename$FG$:

will copy all files in a file partition to a Windows directory, making them available from Windows.


$BK,1$WARNING:$BK,0$ Do not attempt to uncompress files twice or it may crash.If there are any files ending in '$FG,2$Z$FG$' which are present, it'll may crash too.You might get really unlucky and it uncompresses and creates havoc.

$BK,1$WARNING:$BK,0$ Do not run a defrag operation on a partition holding a file partition.If you store files to it after such an operation, you'll ruin data on your hard drive.
