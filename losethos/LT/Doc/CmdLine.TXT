$WW,1$The cmd line feeds into a $FG,2$C+$FG$ compiler as you type.A statement outside a function executes immediately.Remember to add a semicolon.$WW,1$

Look-up the function headers with $FG,2$WordStat$FG$ by hitting $FG,2$<CTRL-SHIFT-F1>$FG$ after typing the first few letters.

$LK,"Click Here","MN:Dir"$ to see the directory cmd header.It accepts default args from $FG,2$C++$FG$.

$FG,4$Dir("*.TXZ");$FG$

If you don't have args, you don't need parenthesis.

$FG,4$Dir;$FG$

$FG,4$Ed("NewFile.CPZ");$FG$

Most filenames end in '$FG,2$Z$FG$' because they are stored compressed if the last letter is '$FG,2$Z$FG$'.

Drives are specified with a letter.The boot drive is specified with a '$FG,2$:$FG$'.

$FG,4$Drv('B');		$FG,2$B$FG$ drive

The drive can be specified in a $LK,"Cd","MN:Cd"$() command as in:

$FG,4$Cd("B:/Temp");		$FG,2$B$FG$ drive
$FG,4$Cd("::/LT/Demo");$FG$	Boot drive

$FG,4$$FG,4$Cd("HOME/MusicOrgan");	$FG,2$HOME$FG$ is a dir

You can place macros in your personal menu for $LK,"Cd","MN:Cd"$() commands.$FG,2$<WINDOWS KEY>$FG$ to access your menu.
