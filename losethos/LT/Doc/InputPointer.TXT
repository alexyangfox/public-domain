$LK,"ipx","MN:ipx"$ and $LK,"ipy","MN:ipy"$ can be used to access the x and y coordinates of the input ptr.They are relative to the screen, not window.These can be used if you don't want to use msg passing.$LK,"ipz","MN:ipz"$ is the wheel.

$LK,"iptx","MN:iptx"$ and $LK,"ipty","MN:ipty"$ are the text column and row of the input ptr.See $LK,"::/LT/Demo/Maze.CPZ","FI:::/LT/Demo/Maze.CPZ"$.
