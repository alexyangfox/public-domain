$WW,1$$FG,5$$TX+CX,"Upgrading LoseThos"$$FG$

To upgrade, you generally boot the new LoseThos CD/DVD, install on top of your partition, modify your files and set it to boot your account by executing $LK,"InstallBoot","MN:InstallBoot"$().Often, your code will have to be modified to work with the new version.See $LK,"ChangeLog","FI:::/LT/Doc/ChangeLog.TXZ"$.You might have to boot an alternate partition or the CD and modify your code until it boots okay.

The $FG,2$INSTALL$FG$ option when you boot a CD will install on top of an existing install if you tell it not to delete the $FG,2$/LT$FG$ directory.

See the $LK,"Installing","FI:::/LT/Doc/Install.TXZ"$ documentation.
