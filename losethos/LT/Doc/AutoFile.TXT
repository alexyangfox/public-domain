$WW,1$$FG,2$AutoFiles$FG$ are used to generate user input to automate operations.The LoseThos tour is done with an $FG,2$AutoFile$FG$.

When an $FG,2$AutoFile$FG$ runs, a child task is $LK,"Spawn","MN:Spawn"$()ed which intercepts real user input and generates fake input.AutoFiles are $FG,2$C+$FG$ programs run by the child who's stdout goes to the parent's input buffer.$LK,"Msg","MN:Msg"$() can be included in an $FG,2$AutoFile$FG$ to send special keys or mouse cmds to the parent.While an $FG,2$AutoFile$FG$ is running, the normal input gets diverted to the AutoFile task and can be filtered and sent back to the parent task.Unless you are driving functions which prompt for data, you can probably use an $FG,2$#include$FG$ file in place of an $FG,2$AutoFile$FG$.

See $LK,"::/LT/Demo/AutoFile/Demo1.AUZ","FI:::/LT/Demo/AutoFile/Demo1.AUZ"$.

Note: $LK,"Auto","MN:Auto"$("") can be used if all you need is to send ASCII characters.It differs from $LK,"AutoStr","MN:AutoStr"$().You'll probably use $LK,"Auto","MN:Auto"$() a lot and not $LK,"AutoStr","MN:AutoStr"$().With $LK,"Auto","MN:Auto"$(), for example, you can place answers to the prompts for recompiling the $FG,2$OSMain$FG$ module during $LK,"InstallBoot","MN:InstallBoot"$().
