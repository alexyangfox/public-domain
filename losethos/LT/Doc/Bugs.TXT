$FG,2$#000027 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:04/22/2012$FG$
Compiler used 0 displacement off of RBP in rare circumstances.

$FG,2$#000026 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:03/27/2012$FG$
Rare uninitialized value problem in compiler fixed.

$FG,2$#000025 Introduced:12/10/2011 Fixed:12/20/2011$FG$
In certain cases, floats as array indexes were still broken.

$FG,2$#000024 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:12/16/2011$FG$
The heap-control free-chunk-list was allowed to get too long and caused crashes from long delays.Now, it transfers free-list chunks into the heap hash, every-so-often.(During $LK,"AllocMemBlks","MN:AllocMemBlks"$).

$FG,2$#000023 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:12/10/2011$FG$
In certain cases, floats as array indexes were broken.

$FG,2$#000022 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:10/29/2011$FG$
In certain cases, the compiler wrongly optimized local variable arrays as reg vars.

$FG,2$#000021 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:10/10/2011$FG$
Graphics routines did not work with $FG,4$->brush$FG$ when $FG,4$->pen_width$FG$ was big.

$FG,2$#000020 Introduced:03/06/2011 Fixed:10/9/2011$FG$
$FG,4$<CTRL-R>$FG$ menu was broken so that clicking "Vect Object Menu", exited.

$FG,2$#000019 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:9/8/2011$FG$
$LK,"ToHtml","FI:::/LT/Adam/ToHtml.APZ"$() and $LK,"ToTXT","FI:::/LT/Adam/ToTXT.APZ"$() were not handling backward column movement well.

$FG,2$#000018 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:8/14/2011$FG$
Compiler was not doing 64-bit arithmetic where it was spec'ed to.

$FG,2$#000017 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:8/14/2011$FG$
Compiler was falsely optimizing SIGNED MODULO operator to AND for powers of two.

$FG,2$#000016 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:1/22/2011$FG$
ATAPI start-up probe hung because timeout wasn't implemented right.This possible used to work.

$FG,2$#000015 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:1/22/2011$FG$
A pending IRQ left-over from BIOS code might have crashed LoseThos when it enabled interrupts.Now, stub IRQ handlers should absorb a pending IRQ.

$FG,2$#000014 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:1/22/2011$FG$
Fmt() FAT32 didn't set partition type in master boot record!

$FG,2$#000013 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:1/11/2011$FG$
Bible links to Genesis didn't work.

$FG,2$#000012 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:12/5/2010$FG$
$LK,"TssNew","MN:TssNew"$() used to truncate the tss addr to 32-bits!I'm not sure how it worked before!

$FG,2$#000011 Introduced:11/18/2010 Fixed:11/19/2010$FG$
The fix to $LK,"FileExtRem","MN:FileExtRem"$() made a new bug, for a day preventing booting!Sorry!

$FG,2$#000010 Introduced:10/11/2010 Fixed:11/18/2010$FG$
$LK,"FileExtRem","MN:FileExtRem"$() removed all if no extension.

$FG,2$#000009 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:11/16/2010$FG$
ATA Hard disk code checked an unnecessary stat bit.It prevented Virtual Box from writing to the hard disk.

$FG,2$#000008 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:11/04/2010$FG$
Compiler: += / -= of immediate values on non-64bit variables.

$FG,2$#000007 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:09/14/2010$FG$
VMWare sometimes crashed on quick reboot.I think it was because the timer interrupt could occur between start-up of MP and initialization of MP.Core zero would fwd an interrupt to an uninitialized core.

$FG,2$#000006 Introduced:06/15/2010 Fixed:09/01/2010$FG$
Compiler crashed on return out of $FG,2$try{}$FG$ or $FG,2$catch{}$FG$.

$FG,2$#000005 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:08/28/2010$FG$
Compiler loaded args into reg variables using 64-bit $FG,2$MOV$FG$ even for smaller sizes.

$FG,2$#000004 Introduced:05/20/2010 Fixed:06/05/2010$FG$
$LK,"GetKey","MN:GetKey"$() was not handling pop-up windows properly.As a result, the tour and autofile operations were broken.

$FG,2$#000003 Introduced:05/20/2010 Fixed:06/05/2010$FG$
$LK,"GetKey","MN:GetKey"$() was turning-off preemption in its call to echo with $LK,"PutKey","MN:PutKey"$().This had the effect of running all terminal window right-clicked #included programs with preemption off. 

$FG,2$#000002 Introduced:00/00/2009 Fixed:06/05/2010$FG$
Compiler optimization was screwing-up code like this:
$ID,2$$FG,5$while (*dst++=*src++);
$ID,-2$

$FG,2$#000001 Introduced:00/00/0000 Fixed:05/14/2010$FG$
$LK,"PrintF","MN:SPrintFJoin"$()'s "%g", "%e", and "%n" horribly broken, due to rounding.
