* The keyboard can be used as an organ by typing letter keys or clicking the mouse on the keyboard diagram$FG$.You can "record" notes by pressing the red button and typing letters.They will appear on the musical staff.You can edit and save them.

* The clipboard can be used to cut and paste.

* $FG,2$MusicOrgan$FG$ uses $FG,2$C+$FG$ files as it's fmt!See $LK,"::/LT/Apps/MusicOrgan/Examples/personal.CPZ","FI:::/LT/Apps/MusicOrgan/Examples/personal.CPZ"$.It does not fully parse them when loading back in, so changes made outside $FG,2$MusicOrgan$FG$ can be lost.

* The first line of the $FG,2$C+$FG$ files has a comment with a category recognized by $LK,"JukeBox","FF:::/LT/Apps/MusicOrgan/JukeBox.CPZ,JukeBox"$().The categories are $FG,2$"no nothing"$FG$, $FG,2$"has words"$FG$, $FG,2$"has graphics"$FG$, or $FG,2$"special"$FG$.The third character in the comment is a digit rating number.

* You can take the $LK,"Play","MN:Play"$() statements out of a song file and place them in your programs.You can also add a song to a document with $FG,2$<CTRL-L>$FG$, but you should do it after pressing $FG,2$<CTRL-T>$FG$ because the clipboard-insert in $FG,2$<CTRL-L>$FG$ is screwy.  See this $SO,"<Song>","2qG3ECB2eGG3qCeFDsBGBG2qG3ECB2eGG3qCeFDsBGBGqEeEFqEB2eG3FetCAGqFCEeEFqEB2eG3FetCAGqFC"$ after pressing $FG,2$<CTRL-T>$FG$, now.

* You can call $LK,"JukeBox","FF:::/LT/Apps/MusicOrgan/JukeBox.CPZ,JukeBox"$("HOME/MusicOrgan"); to play your songs.

* To create a $FG,2$.SND$FG$ file which can be exported and played under Windows, set the $FG,2$BoolI8$FG$ $LK,"snd_record","MN:snd_record"$ to $FG,2$TRUE$FG$, play music, and set it to $FG,2$FALSE$FG$.Then, call $LK,"SndFileCreate","MN:SndFileCreate"$().You might wish to make a $FG,2$<CTRL-ALT-key>$FG$ to toggle this system level recording feat.See $LK,"Snd","MN:Snd"$().Add this code to your $LK,"HOME/Adam3dKeyPlugIns.APZ","FI:HOME/Adam3dKeyPlugIns.APZ"$ file.

* The note accent feat only works when exporting songs.When calling $LK,"SndFileCreate","MN:SndFileCreate"$() you can set a waveform.The PC speaker is $LK,"WF_SQUARE","MN:WF_SQUARE"$.You can select reverb and averaging, also.
