|This line should not be read.
Label0, Label1, Label2, Label3.  | These are the labels.

|And now some attributes:
ATTR0: val0-0, val0-1, val0-2.
| Here val1-X was added so it wouldn't match t_AttrCat.names
ATTR1: val1-X, val1-0, val1-1, val1-2.   | Oh neat, another comment.

ATTR2: val2-0, val2-1, val2-2, val2-3, | within the value list

	val2-4	| skipped a line; some tabs; no period at the end
ATTR3: val3-0, val3-1, val3-2, val3-3

	ATTR4:
val4-0, val4-1	, | should remove the trailing whitespace
val4-2, continuous. | the name continuous should be legal when not first.

ATTR5: val5-0 is long enough to cause a new line in display,
val5-1, val5-2

|That's all I have for now.
|Only NominalAttrInfo is used now.
