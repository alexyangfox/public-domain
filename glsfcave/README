GLSFcave is a port of SunFlat's SFcave for UNIX/OpenGL.
SFcave is a game where the player controls a ribbon and
avoid hitting walls.

You have only one control: when you hold the mouse button,
the ribbon goes up. Otherwise the ribbon goes down.

** Changes
(1.0->1.1) added sound support with OpenAL.
	performance enhancements
	minor bugfixes

**************
How to compile
**************
You need GLUT to compile and play this game.
If you want sound support you need ALUT(a component of
OpenAL).

* On GNU/Linux or *BSD variants, type `make' to compile
  GLSFcave. If you do not need sound support or do not have
  ALUT, edit the Makefile to comment out two lines.

* On Apple MacOS X, use `Makefile.macosx' like:
  make -f Makefile.macosx
  to get executable `glsfcave'. On this platform sound is not
  supported. 

I checked this game to work on following environments:
  Apple MacOS X 10.5.4(PowerPC) ATI Mobility RADEON 9700
  Ubuntu 8.04(AMD64) Intel GMA X3100
