compress version 4.2.1 improvements
	o Change the name to ncompress because of version problems.
	o Completly rewrite of the compress and decompress functions.
	  compress speedup 25-50% (user cpu time).
	  decompress speedup 20-30% (user cpu time).
    o Add special fast compress hash algorithm.
	o Fix some minor things.
	o use #include <utime.h> if availble.
	o Cleanup the source code (I think so).
	o Test if filename is not to long. This is done on runtime no fix length
      size any more.
	o Powerfull build script (test almost every thing).

Modifications for version 4.1: 
	o Added -r command line flag to allow recursive compression/
	  decompression of directory trees. As a side-effect, compress
	  no longer tries to compress/decompress anything that isn't
	  a regular file. In particular, it ignores symbolic links.
	o zcat no longer cares whether a filename ends in .Z or
	  not - it relies on the magic number in the file. If zcat
	  is given a filename that doesn't end with .Z and the file
	  referenced doesn't exist, zcat will append a .Z and try
	  to open that instead.
	o compress -f will now compress multiply hardlinked files.
	  Uncompress does not recreate the hard link, it creates
	  a new file.
	o Removed compressdir/uncompressdir - no longer needed.
	o Removed atob/btoa/tarmail/untarmail - my versions are
	  based on btoa 5.2 which is not compatible with the atob
	  included with compress4.0.

Compress version 4.0 improvements:
	o compress() speedup (10-50%) by changing division hash to xor
	o decompress() speedup (5-10%)
	o Memory requirements reduced (3-30%)
	o Stack requirements reduced to less than 4kb
	o Removed 'Big+Fast' compress code (FBITS) because of compress speedup
	o Portability mods for Z8000 and PC/XT (but not zeus 3.2)
	o Default to 'quiet' mode
	o Unification of 'force' flags
	o Manual page overhaul
	o Portability enhancement for M_XENIX
	o Removed text on #else and #endif
	o Added "-V" switch to print version and options
	o Added #defines for SIGNED_COMPARE_SLOW
	o Added Makefile and "usermem" program
	o Removed all floating point computations
	o New programs:
		compressdir - compress all files on a directory
		uncompressdir - uncompress all files on a directory
		zcmp - cmp compressed files
		zdiff - diff compressed files
	  The following are with thanks to philabs!per:
		btoa - convert binary to ascii for mailing
		atob - convert ascii to binary with checksum
		tarmail - tar, compress, btoa, and mail files
		untarmail - restore "tarmail" files

		WARNING: These last few programs are not compatible 
		with the original ones from the net.  The encoding
		has changed.  See btoa.c for more info.
