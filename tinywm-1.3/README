TinyWM is written by Nick Welch <mack@incise.org>, 2005.

TinyWM is a ridiculously tiny window manager implemented in nearly as few lines
of C as possible, without being obfuscated or entirely useless. It allows you
to move, resize, focus (sloppy), and raise windows -- that's it!  TinyWM's main
purpose is to serve as a quick example of some window manager programming
basics.

Files:

  Makefile: highly advanced build system
  tinywm.c: the code
  annotated.c: same, but with tons of rambling comments about everything
  tinywm.py: a python version (requires CVS python-xlib due to a bug)

Usage:

  Focus follows pointer.
  Alt+Button1, drag: interactive window move
  Alt+Button3, drag: interactive window resize
  Alt+F1: raise focused window

Misc:
  
  A fella by the name of Trent Buck made a lisp version:

  I have started a wiki about window manager development, although I'm not sure
  the subject is popular enough for the wiki to keep from dying a horrible
  death.  In any case, it is here:

  Another very small window manager is failsafewm.  Originally I started
  hacking on it, as there was quite a bit of stuff in it that I thought was
  unneeded, and I wound up rewriting it from scratch, with just the bare
  necessities -- that's TinyWM.

  Yet another small -- but in comparison, big -- window manager is aewm.  It's
  a good example for learning about window management, and the fact that so
  many WMs have spawned from it is proof.
