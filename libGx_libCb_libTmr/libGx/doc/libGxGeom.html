<h1 class="western">Overview</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Most of libGx's owner widgets can
have multiple children. The order in which the children are
constructed is important, as child widgets are placed in the same order
as
they are constructed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">LibGx has a variety of special purpose
geometry control classes that override the default algorithm like GxRow
GxColumn, GxTable, etc.<br>
</p>
<h1>Default Placement Algorithm<br>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The default placement algorithm for
each parent works by starting with four integers initialized as
follows:</p>
<pre>int lX = 0;        /* left X */<br>int rX = width;    /* right X */<br>int tY = 0;        /* top Y */<br>int bY = height;   /* bottom Y */</pre>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">These integers represent the area
available for placement within the parent window (Parent's Available
Area). The parent then traverses its list of children, passing
references to these four integers into each of its children's Place()
functions. The children (may) then pass these four integers into a
pluggable GxGeomControl module that place the child within the
parent's available area. The children then (can) update the four
integers to guide subsequent children's placement in the reduced
parent's area.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">If a child was not given a
GxGeomControl module, its default action is to size and place itself
to consume the full parent's available area . This of course leaves
no area to place other children in the parents children list.&nbsp;
This
is ok much of the time as the default behavior can be exploited.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Two important GxGeomControl modules
that implement the default placing behavior are the GxBasic and the
GxSIBasic classes. Both modules work similarly, except the GxSIBasic
module can specify an additional 'whitespace' border to be defined
around the
child it is plugged into.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The GxBasic's constructor is as
follows.</p>
<pre>GxBasic::GxBasic(GX_WD_STAT tPWidth, GX_HT_STAT tPHeight, GX_H_PLACEMENT tHPlace, GX_V_PLACEMENT tVPlace,<br>                 bool tHReset = false, bool tVReset = false);</pre>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">where the enums used as parameters are
defined as:</p>
<pre>enum GX_WD_STAT{GX_WD_FIXED, GX_WD_FILL, GX_WD_INT};<br>enum GX_HT_STAT{GX_HT_FIXED, GX_HT_FILL, GX_HT_INT};<br>enum GX_H_PLACEMENT{GX_H_FIXED, GX_H_CENTERED, GX_FLOW_LEFT, GX_FLOW_RIGHT};<br>enum GX_V_PLACEMENT{GX_V_FIXED, GX_V_CENTERED, GX_FLOW_UP, GX_FLOW_DOWN};</pre>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The child's width is established by the
tPWidth variable which may have one of the following values:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre>GX_WD_FIXED </pre>
      </td>
      <td> The Width() of the
child is not modified</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre>GX_WD_FILL </pre>
      </td>
      <td>The child is expanded in
width until it fills the area of the parent</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre>GX_WD_INT </pre>
      </td>
      <td>The child's width is set
to the value returned by pChild-&gt;GetDesiredWidth()</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The child is placed in X (after it has
been sized for width) based on the value of tHPlace which may have
one of the following (self explanatory) values: GX_FLOW_LEFT,
GX_FLOW_RIGHT, GX_H_CENTERED.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">When an child is placed so that it
flows to the left, it is moved to the minimum x value in the parents
specified area ie. pChild-&gt;X(lX). When a child is placed so that
it flows to the right it is moved so that its right edge is aligned
with the right edge in the parents available area I.e. pChild-&gt;X(
rX &#8211; pChild-&gt;Width();</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The child's height is established by
the tPHeight variable which may have one of the following values: <br>
</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre>GX_HT_FIXED </pre>
      </td>
      <td>The Height() of the
child is not modified</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre>GX_HT_INT </pre>
      </td>
      <td>The Height() of the child
is set to the value returned by pChild-&gt;GetDesiredHeight();</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
      <pre>GX_HT_FILL </pre>
      </td>
      <td>The child's height is
expanded until it fills the area of the parent.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The child is placed in Y (after it has
been sized for width) based on the value of tVPlace which may have
one of the following (self explanatory) values: GX_FLOW_TOP,
GX_FLOW_BOTTOM,
GX_V_CENTERED.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">When a child is placed so that it flows
up, it is moved to the minimum y value in the parents specified area,
i.e. pChild-&gt;Y(tY). When a child is placed so that it flows down,
it is moved so that its bottom edge is aligned with the bottom edge
in the parents available area, i.e. pChild-&gt;Y(bY &#8211;
pChild-&gt;Height() );</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">If a child flows up or down (or left or
right) it can reset its parent's available area (remember through the
lX, rX, tY, bY). The GxBasic and GxSIBasic plugins will do so by
default <u style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-style: italic;">if</u>
they know the child will span the width or height
of the parent's available area by looking for GX_WD_FILL and/or
GX_HT_FILL. There are two boolean parameters that can force the
reset of the parent's available area that can be useful in the cases
where the child is sized as GX_WD_INT or GX_HT_INT. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The GxSIBasic geometry control module
enhances the GxBasic module by adding the ability to add a spacing
border around the child. The child is placed identically to the
GxBasic case, but it is considered to be larger than its actual size
by the widths of the defined border. The spacing increment is not in
pixels, but is in a theoretically 'display independent' variable
based on the height of the default font. (It is actually a dumb
constant at the moment)</p>
<h1>Example<br>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As an example we'll create a dialog
box.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"></p>
<pre>class MyDialog : public GxPopupWin<br>{<br>public:<br>     MyDialog(GxTopLevelWin *pOwner);<br>     virtual ~MyDialog(void);<br><br>     bool DoDialog(void);<br><br>protected:<br>     void Ok(void);<br>     void Cancel(void);<br>     bool retStatus;<br><br>     /* the <u>order</u> of construction matters here, the placement algorithm depends on it */<br>     GxRow buttonRow; //the ok/cancel button row<br><br>     GxButton ok, cancel; //could be constructed any point after the button row, but makes sense here <br><br>     GxHLine hLine;<br><br>     GxLabel textLabel;<br>     GxTextWin textWin;<br>};</pre>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The constructor for MyDialog finishes
up specifying widget placement</p>
<pre>MyDialog::MyDialog(GxTopLevelWin *pOwner) :<br>    GxPopupWin(pOwner),<br>    buttonRow(this), ok(&amp;buttonRow,"Ok"), cancel(&amp;buttonRow, "Cancel"),<br>    hLine(this),<br>&nbsp;   textLabel(this, "Text is here:"),<br>&nbsp;   textWin(this)<br>{<br>&nbsp;//set a default size for the top level window (it will be resize-able by the window manager)<br>&nbsp;width = 500;<br>&nbsp;height = 400;<br><br> //adding this just means the top window will not try to shrink down to the size of its children<br> //i.e. it will respect the above values (but again the Window Manager is free to override)<br> SetGeomControl( GxFixed() );<br><br>&nbsp;//set the widths and heights of the button row's children to be identical.<br>&nbsp;buttonRow.SetWidthIdentical(true);<br>&nbsp;buttonRow.SetHeightIdentical(true);<br><br>&nbsp;//the hline widget has a little border on its top and bottom, so we<br> //don't need to add one to the button row.<br> buttonRow.SetGeomControl( GxSIBasic(GX_WD_FILL, GX_HT_INT, GX_FLOW_LEFT, GX_FLOW_DOWN, 1,1,0,1) );<br><br> //the hline has only one vertical size, so it can have GX_HT_FIXED (or GX_HT_INT)<br> hLine.SetGeomControl( GxSIBasic(GX_WD_FILL, GX_HT_FIXED, GX_FLOW_LEFT, GX_FLOW_DOWN, 1,1,0,0) );<br><br>&nbsp;//let the text label flow to the top left of the window<br>&nbsp;//the final false, true forces the remaining parent area to not be changed in X, but to be reset in Y to include<br>&nbsp;//the height of this widget. If the desired width specifier would be set to GX_WD_FILL instead of GX_WD_INT, the<br>&nbsp;//final true false could be excluded because the placement action that would occur would<br> //be the same as what we are forcing to happen</pre>
<pre> textLabel.SetGeomControl( GxSIBasic(GX_WD_INT, GX_HT_INT, GX_FLOW_LEFT, GX_FLOW_UP, 1,1,1,1, false, true) );<br><br>&nbsp;//the text window does not need a geom control as it will fill the available area left in the window.<br>&nbsp;//textWin.SetGeomControl();<br><br>&nbsp;//we can set some callbacks<br>&nbsp;ok.cb.Assign( CbVoidMember&lt;MyDialog&gt;(this, &amp;MyDialog::Ok) );<br>&nbsp;cancel.cb.Assign( CbVoidMember&lt;MyDialog&gt;(this, &amp;MyDialog::Cancel) );<br><br> Place(); //compute sizes and positions of x11 windows<br> Create(); //create all x11 windows (and necessary gc, colors, etc)<br>};<br><br>MyDialog::~MyDialog(void)<br>{}<br><br>bool MyDialog::DoDialog(void)<br>{<br>&nbsp;Display(); //recursively map the dialog's window tree<br>&nbsp;EventLoop();<br>&nbsp;return retStatus;<br>}<br><br>void MyDialog::Ok(void)<br>{<br> retStatus = true;<br>&nbsp;processEvents = false;<br>}<br><br>void MyDialog::Cancel(void)<br>{<br>&nbsp;retStatus = false;<br>&nbsp;processEvents = false;<br>};</pre>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Note:</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">If the c++ force is strong with you,
you have noticed that the compiler knows the variable sizes of all
widgets, and that to
create the dialog class itself requires only a single new call (or
even just a simple push to the stack). The libGx design is not
perfectly optimal in this respect as specifying the geom control
plugins and the
function callbacks still need to use new() internally (This happens
when they are Clone()'ed by the SetGeomControl() or Assign()
functions). This compromise was felt to be necessary in order to
keep the libGx API simple.</p>
