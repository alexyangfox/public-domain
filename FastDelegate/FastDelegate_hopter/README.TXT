SOME HELPER TOOLS USED IN CREATING THE FASTDELEGATE LIBRARY

They are not very impressive, and are included only for completeness.

A. HOW TO CREATE FASTDELEGATE.H

1. Compile Hopter.cpp to form Hopter.exe
2. On the command line, type:
HOPTER FastDelegate.hxx FastDelegate.h

An explanation of what the program does is in Hopter.cpp.

B. TEST FILE USED TO DISCOVER MFP REPRESENTATION

If you have a compiler not listed in the article, compile
the 'memfuntest.cpp' file to an asm listing.
For example, with GCC you would type:

g++ -S memfuntest.cpp

Email the asm file to me.

Thanks for your interest!
