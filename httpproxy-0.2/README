WHAT IS THIS?

This is version 0.2 of httpproxy, a program that, together
with other programs like tcpconnect (from tcputils) or stunnel,
can facilitate TCP programming through firewalls in shell-
scripts.

Much of the source was borrowed from tcputils version 0.6.2,
courtesy of the author Thomas Bellman, and this pakage therefore
carries the same copyright and license (see the LICENSE file).

The latest released version can be found by anonymous FTP to:

	ftp://ftp.stacken.kth.se/pub/httpproxy/

I can be reached by email to levitte@stacken.kth.se.
