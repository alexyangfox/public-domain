Hello,

Yes - I forfeit all rights, commercial and non-commercial regarding use, distribution, attribution, and creation of derivative works to the utmost extent permissible by law in any relevant jurisdiction. If possible, I place Pexio in the public domain.

I'm no lawyer, but hopefully that's sufficiently emphatic to cover you in any circumstance. Having said this, I wrote that code when I was about 13 years old, so I can't say that I'm sure it's of much use to anyone! :-) Feel free to do with it as you wish.

Best wishes,
Angus Lepper.

    Hi,

    I\'m collecting public domain source code (
    http://www.cod5.org/archive/ ) and I would be sure that
    Pexio is really in the public domain.
    Do you really abandon all your rights on this software ?

    Thanks in adavance.
