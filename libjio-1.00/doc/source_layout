Source layout
-------------

The source is structured so code can be read and reviewed in an independant
way, following the way the code really works.

The main file is called "trans.c" which contains the transaction API; all the
other wrappers depend on it, and they're the core of the library.

There is also a "common.c" file with some common functions.

And finally, "unix.c" which implement the wrappers for the UNIX API (read(),
write() and their family), and "ansi.c" where ANSI wrappers live (fopen(),
fread(), etc.).

If you're trying to read the code for the first time, you can start from
either from the more simple unix.c which relies on trans.c; or from trans.c
which is what everything else relies on, and then the wrappers will be
obvious.
