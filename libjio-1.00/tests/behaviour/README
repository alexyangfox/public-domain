In this directory you'll find libjio's automated behaviour tests.

They're split in three suites: normal, corruption and fi. The normal suite
tests normal, expected behaviour. The corruption suite checks how the library
behaves in presence of disk corruption. The fi suite uses libfiu to inject
faults in order to simulate unexpected interruptions (like power failures) and
checks how the library behaves in those cases.

To run them, use "./runtests <suite name>". To run all tests, you can run
"./runtests all".

Note that the corruption and fi suite depends on libfiu being installed, and
libjio having been built using FI=1.
