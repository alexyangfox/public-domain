libjio - A library for Journaled I/O
------------------------------------

libjio is a simple userspace library to do journaled, transaction-oriented
I/O.

It provides a transaction API to commit and rollback transactions, and on top
of that a unix-alike set of functions to perform most regular operations (ie.
open, read, write, etc.).

The library guarantees file integrity even after unexpected crashes, never
leaving your files in an inconsistent state.

You can find more detailed documents, including the programmer's guide, in the
doc/ directory, and the manpage in the libjio/ directory.


To see how to install it, please read the INSTALL file.

It is in the public domain, see the LICENSE file for more details.

Comments and patches are always welcome; please send them to
