<h1>Information for distributors</h1>
If you're a distributor, you should join the
<a href="../lists.html#qmaildist">qmaildist mailing list</a>.
<p>
I hereby place the qmail package (in particular,
qmail-1.03.tar.gz,
with MD5 checksum 622f65f982e380dbe86e6574f3abcb7c)
into the public domain.
You are free to modify the package,
distribute modified versions, etc.
<p>
This does not mean that modifications are encouraged!
Please take time to ensure that your distribution of qmail supports
<a href="../compatibility.html">exactly the same interface</a>
as everyone else's.
In particular, if you move files,
please set up symbolic links from the original locations,
so that you don't frivolously break scripts that work everywhere else.
