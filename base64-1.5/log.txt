2005 April 13

Working version changed to 1.4.

Modified Makefile.in to use the system's installation of
Autoconf rather than a special one hard-coded in a
private directory.  Remade ./configure with Autoconf 2.59.

Converted the HTML page title image from GIF to PNG.  Added
some XHTML quotes to image attributes in index.html.

2005 December 21

Completed conversion of the HTML document to XHTML 1.0 and
validated.

Added "Send Feedback" and Validate XHTML buttons.

Release 1.4.

2007 June 10

Working version changed to 1.5.

When encoding with FORCE_BINARY_IO mode in effect, the explicit "\r\n"
end of line sequence caused double carriage returns in the output,
because the output text file is subject to expansion of LF to CR/LF
line terminators.  I made the "eol" sequence conditional on
FORCE_BINARY, so that just a line feed is written to streams
which will expand it.  (Reported by Lee Bradley.)

Built a new Windows binary with Visual C .NET.  The base64.sln
and base64.vcproj files used for this build have been added to
the source distribution, along with a testw32.bat file which
performs a rudimentary test of the Debug and Release builds
of the WIN32 edition.  Note that when building the WIN32
version, the config.h file created by the Linux ./configure
script must be hand-edited to comment out the definitions of
HAVE_GETOPT and HAVE_UNISTD_H.

Release 1.5.
