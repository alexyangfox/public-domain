/*
 *      Details
 *
 *  This file contains some tests of printf()-style print formatting.  The
 *  tests are all designed to cause errors to be flagged in the sprintf()-based
 *  floating-point conversion algorithm.  The errors are caused by exceeding
 *  the limits of this particular conversion algorithm.  These test cases may
 *  or may not cause errors with other floating-point conversion algorithms.
 *
 *  The format of the tests is as calls to the macro PRINT_TEST().  This macro
 *  is not defined here and should be defined appropriately by the code that
 *  includes this file.  The first argument to the macro is an argument list in
 *  printf() style, starting with a format string and optionally continuing
 *  with other arguments.  The second argument is a string literal specifying
 *  the expected result of formatting the string as specified by the argument
 *  list of the first argument.
 *
 *  These tests are not exhaustive.  They are simply intended to test a
 *  sampling of some of the cases that exceeed the limits of the
 *  sprintf()-based conversion algorithm.
 *
 *  These tests are designed as part of a suite of tests that is intended to
 *  cover all the code that tests can reasonably cover in the sprintf()-based
 *  conversion algorithm.
 *
 *
 *      History
 *
 *  This code was written by me, Chris Wilson, in 2008 and placed in the public
 *  domain at that time.  It's entirely new code and isn't based on anything I
 *  or anyone else has written in the past.
 *
 *
 *      Legal Issues
 *
 *  I've written this code from scratch, without using or refering to any other
 *  code, on my own equipment and not for hire for anyone else, so I have full
 *  legal rights to place it in the public domain.
 *
 *  I've chosen to put this software in the public domain rather than
 *  copyrighting it and using the FSF's GPL or a Berkeley-style ``vanity''
 *  license because my personal opinion is that making it public domain
 *  maximizes its potential usefulness to others.  Anyone can feel free to use
 *  it for any purpose, including with their own proprietary code or with GPL
 *  code, without fear of intellectual property issues.  I have no desire to
 *  stop anyone else from making money on this code or getting any other
 *  advantages they can from it.
 *
 *  I do request that anyone who finds this software useful let me know about
 *  it.  You can drop me e-mail at "Chris Wilson" <chris@chriswilson.info> to
 *  let me know how you are using it and what is good and bad about it for you.
 *  Bug reports are also appreciated.  Also, if you release a product or
 *  software package of some sort that includes this software, I would like you
 *  to give me credit in the documentation as appropriate for the importance of
 *  my code in your product.  These are requests, not requirements, so you are
 *  not legally bound to do them, they're just a nice way to show appreciation.
 *
 *  Note that even though this software is public domain and there are no
 *  copyright laws that limit what you can do with it, other laws may apply.
 *  For example, if you lie and claim that you wrote this code when you did
 *  not, or you claim that I endorse a product of yours when I do not, that
 *  could be fraud and you could be legally liable.
 *
 *  There is absolutely no warranty for this software!  I am warning you now
 *  that it may or may not work.  It may have bugs that cause you a lot of
 *  problems.  I disclaim any implied warranties for merchantability or fitness
 *  for a particular purpose.  The fact that I have written some documentation
 *  on what I intended this software for should not be taken as any kind of
 *  warranty that it will actually behave that way.  I am providing this
 *  software as-is in the hope that it will be useful.
 *
 *          Chris Wilson, 2004, 2008
