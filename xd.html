This page describes, in Unix manual page style,
<b>xd</b>, a utility which dumps files in hexadecimal,
decimal, or octal, with file addresses shown in any of
those formats.  <b>xd</b> can read files in any of the
formats it writes, recreating binary files, including
modifications made by editing the dump with any text
editor.  In addition, <b>xd</b> can transform a binary
file into a C data declaration which permits embedding
its contents into a program.  <b>xd</b> is available as
C source code compatible with most Unix systems and
as a ready-to-run 32-bit Windows executable.

<h3>NAME</h3>
     <b>xd</b> - extended dump and load utility

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
     <b>xd</b> [ <b>-a</b><i>addrfmt</i> <b>-c</b>
         <b>-d</b><i>label</i> <b>-l</b> <b>-n</b><i>datafmt</i>
         <b>-s</b> ] [ <i>infile</i> [  <i>outfile</i> ] ]

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
     <b>xd</b> dumps files in hexadecimal, decimal, or octal, optionally with
     ISO characters side by side.  File addresses can likewise be
     displayed in hex, decimal, or octal notation.

<p>

     <b>xd</b> can <em>read</em> dump files in the same formats it writes and create
     binary files from the data therein.  This allows you to dump a
     binary file with <b>xd</b>, edit it with your favourite text editor,
     then make a new binary file containing whatever changes you've
     made.  When creating a binary file, <b>xd</b> normally assumes you've
     only modified data in place (neither expanding nor contracting
     the file) and verifies file addresses to guarantee this.
     However, a "stream" option is available which ignores file
     addresses so you're free to insert and delete bytes at will.  <b>xd</b>
     thus turns your existing text editor into a binary file editor
     without requiring you to learn any new commands.

<p>

     Finally, <b>xd</b> can read a binary file and emit a C language data
     declaration which contains the data from the file.  This is handy
     when you wish to embed binary data within C programs.

<h3>OPTIONS</h3>
<dl compact>
<dt><b>-a</b><i>addrfmt</i>  <dd>Displays addresses in the dumped file as specified
               by <i>addrfmt</i>: <b>d</b> for decimal, <b>h</b> or <b>x</b> for hexadecimal, and
               <b>o</b> for octal.  By default, addresses are shown in
               hexadecimal.

<p>
<dt><b>-c</b>  <dd>Display ISO characters alongside the numeric
               dump.  Non-printing characters (according to ISO
               8859/1) are shown as periods.  The ISO characters are
               separated from the dump by vertical bar characters,
               which <b>xd</b> treats as comment delimiters when loading a
               file.

<p>
<dt><b>-d</b><i>label</i> <dd>Dumps the file as a C language declaration of  an
               array of <tt>unsigned char</tt> which, when compiled, will
               contain the same data as the binary input file.  The C
               array declaration is given the variable name <i>label</i>, or
               <tt>xd_data</tt> if no label specification is given.  Data are
               declared as individual bytes to guarantee portability
               across architectures with different byte ordering
               conventions, and are expressed as decimal numbers in
               lines of less than 80 characters for maximum
               portability among compilers.  The C operator <tt>sizeof</tt> may
               be applied to the array <i>label</i> to obtain its length in
               bytes.

<p>
<dt><b>-l</b> <dd>Load file from dump.  <b>xd</b> reads a file in the same
               format it writes, creating a binary output file.  Each
               line is assumed to begin with a file address terminated
               by a colon.  Data bytes are separated by white space,
               and any characters after a vertical bar are ignored
               (thus discarding any ISO characters included in the
               dump with the <b>-c</b> option).  If the <b>-s</b> option is not
               specified, each file address is checked against the
               number of bytes written so far to guarantee that no
               bytes have been added or deleted.  Files must be loaded
               with the <b>-a</b> and <b>-n</b> options set the same as when the
               file was dumped.

<p>
<dt><b>-n</b><i>datafmt</i> <dd>Edits bytes in the dumped file as specified by
               <i>datafmt</i>: <b>d</b> for decimal, <b>h</b> or
               <b>x</b> for hexadecimal, and <b>o</b> for octal.  By
               default, bytes are shown in hexadecimal.

<p>
<dt><b>-s</b>  <dd>Stream input when loading file.  If  this  option
               is specified in conjunction with the <b>-l</b> option, file
               addresses are not verified when loading a file and, in
               fact, need not be specified at all.  The input file is
               treated as a stream of byte values separated by white
               space.  This option allows you to create a dump with
               <b>xd</b>, edit it as you wish with any text editor, inserting
               and deleting bytes in the file wherever you like, then
               create a binary file from the modified dump with the
               command <b>xd -l -s</b> <i>dumpfile outfile</i>.

<p>
<dt><b>-u</b>  <dd>Print how-to-call information.
</dl>

<h3>FILES</h3>
     If no <i>infile</i> is specified, <b>xd</b> obtains its input from standard
     input; if no <i>outfile</i> is given, output is sent to standard output.
     The input and output are processed in a strictly serial manner
     regardless of options; consequently <b>xd</b> may be used in pipelines
     without restrictions.

<h3>BUGS</h3>
     Input error checking in load mode might be improved.  Note that
     each byte in load mode must be specified as a number in the same
     format selected by the <b>-n</b> option when the file was dumped,
     separated by white space, and that the <b>-a</b> and <b>-n</b> options must be
     set the same when loading a file as when it was dumped.
