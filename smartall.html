</font></h3>
</center>

<hr />

<p class="j">
Few things are as embarrassing as a program that leaks, yet few errors 
are so easy to commit or as difficult to track down in a large, 
complicated program as failure to release allocated memory. SMARTALLOC 
replaces the standard C library memory allocation functions with 
versions which keep track of buffer allocations and releases and report 
all orphaned buffers at the end of program execution. By including this 
package in your program during development and testing, you can 
identify code that loses buffers right when it's added and most easily 
fixed, rather than as part of a crisis debugging push when the problem 
is identified much later in the testing cycle (or even worse, when the 
code is in the hands of a customer). When program testing is complete, 
simply recompiling with different flags removes SMARTALLOC from your 
program, permitting it to run without speed or storage penalties.
</p>

<p class="j">
In addition to detecting orphaned buffers, SMARTALLOC also helps to 
find other common problems in management of dynamic storage including 
storing before the start or beyond the end of an allocated buffer, 
referencing data through a pointer to a previously released buffer, 
attempting to release a buffer twice or releasing storage not
obtained  from the allocator, and assuming the initial contents of
storage  allocated by functions that do not guarantee a known value. 
SMARTALLOC's checking does not usually add a large amount of overhead 
to a program (except for programs which use <tt>realloc()</tt>
extensively; see below). SMARTALLOC focuses on proper storage 
management rather than internal consistency of the heap as checked by 
the <code>malloc_debug</code> facility available on some systems.
SMARTALLOC does  not conflict with <code>malloc_debug</code> and both
may be used together, if you  wish. SMARTALLOC makes no assumptions
regarding the internal structure  of the heap and thus should be
compatible with any C language  implementation of the standard memory
allocation functions.
</p>

<h3>Installing SMARTALLOC</h3>
<p class="j">
SMARTALLOC is provided as a Zipped archive, <a
href="smartall.zip">smartall.zip</a>;  see the download instructions
below.
</p>

<p class="j">
To install SMARTALLOC in your program, simply add the statement:
</p>

<pre>
<code>#include "smartall.h"</code>
</pre>

<p class="j">
to every C program file which calls any of the memory allocation 
functions (<tt>malloc</tt>, <tt>calloc</tt>, <tt>free</tt>, etc.). 
SMARTALLOC must be used for all memory allocation with a program, so 
it's best to add the <code>#include</code> of
&ldquo;<code>smartall.h</code>&rdquo; to the omnibus  include file for
your entire program, if you have such a thing. Next,  define the
symbol SMARTALLOC in the compilation before the inclusion of
<code>smartall.h</code>. I usually do this by having my
<code>Makefile</code> add the &ldquo;<tt>-DSMARTALLOC</tt>&rdquo; 
option to the C compiler for non-production builds. You can define
the  symbol manually, if you prefer, by adding the statement:
</p>

<pre>
<code>#define SMARTALLOC</code>
</pre>

<p class="j">
before the <code>#include</code> of
&ldquo;<code>smartall.h</code>&rdquo;.
</p>

<p class="j">
At the point where your program is all done and ready to relinquish 
control to the operating system, add the call:
</p>

<p class="j">
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sm_dump(</tt><em>datadump</em><tt>);</tt>
</p>

<p class="j">
where <em>datadump</em> specifies whether the contents of orphaned 
buffers are to be dumped in addition printing to their size and place 
of allocation. The data are dumped only if <em>datadump</em> is 
nonzero, so most programs will normally use
&ldquo;<tt>sm_dump(0);</tt>&rdquo;.  If a mysterious orphaned buffer
appears that can't be identified from  the information this prints
about it, replace the statement with
&ldquo;<tt>sm_dump(1)</tt>;&rdquo;.  Usually the dump of the buffer's
data will furnish the additional clues  you need to excavate and
extirpate the elusive error that left the  buffer allocated.
</p>

<p class="j">
Finally, add the files &ldquo;<code>smartall.h</code>&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;<code>smartall.c</code>&rdquo; from this release to your source
directory, make  dependencies, and linker input. You needn't make
inclusion of  <code>smartall.c</code> in your link optional; if
compiled with SMARTALLOC not  defined it generates no code, so you may
always include it knowing it  will waste no storage in production
builds. Now when you run your  program, if it leaves any buffers
around when it's done, each will be  reported by <tt>sm_dump()</tt> on
<code>stderr</code> as follows:
</p>

<pre>
Orphaned buffer:     120 bytes allocated at line 50 of gutshot.c
</pre>

<h3>Squelching a SMARTALLOC</h3>

<p class="j">
Usually, when you first install SMARTALLOC in an existing program 
you'll find it nattering about lots of orphaned buffers. Some of these 
turn out to be legitimate errors, but some are storage allocated during 
program initialisation that, while dynamically allocated, is logically 
static storage not intended to be released. Of course, you can get rid 
of the complaints about these buffers by adding code to release them, 
but by doing so you're adding unnecessary complexity and code size to 
your program just to silence the nattering of a SMARTALLOC, so an 
escape hatch is provided to eliminate the need to release these 
buffers.
</p>

<p class="j">
Normally all storage allocated with the functions <tt>malloc()</tt>,
<tt>calloc()</tt>,  and <tt>realloc()</tt> is monitored by SMARTALLOC.
If you make the  function call:
</p>

<pre>
        sm_static(1);
</pre>

<p class="j">
you declare that subsequent storage allocated by <tt>malloc()</tt>,
<tt>calloc()</tt>,  and <tt>realloc()</tt> should not be considered
orphaned if found to be  allocated when <tt>sm_dump()</tt> is called.
I use a call on &ldquo;<tt>sm_static(1);</tt>&rdquo;  before I
allocate things like program configuration tables so I don't  have to
add code to release them at end of program time. After  allocating
unmonitored data this way, be sure to add a call to:
</p>

<pre>
        sm_static(0);
</pre>

<p class="j">
to resume normal monitoring of buffer allocations. Buffers allocated 
while <tt>sm_static(1</tt>) is in effect are not checked for having 
been orphaned but all the other safeguards provided by SMARTALLOC 
remain in effect. You may release such buffers, if you like; but you 
don't have to.
</p>

<h3>Living with Libraries</h3>

<p class="j">
Some library functions for which source code is unavailable may 
gratuitously allocate and return buffers that contain their results, or 
require you to pass them buffers which they subsequently release. If 
you have source code for the library, by far the best approach is to 
simply install SMARTALLOC in it, particularly since this kind of 
ill-structured dynamic storage management is the source of so many 
storage leaks. Without source code, however, there's no option but to 
provide a way to bypass SMARTALLOC for the buffers the library 
allocates and/or releases with the standard system functions.
</p>

<p class="j">
For each function <em>xxx</em> redefined by SMARTALLOC, a corresponding 
routine named &ldquo;<tt>actually</tt><em>xxx</em>&rdquo; is furnished 
which provides direct access to the underlying system function, as 
follows:
</p>

<center>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th align="left">Standard function </th>
        <th align="left">Direct access function </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><tt>malloc(</tt><i>size</i><tt>)</tt></td>
        <td><tt>actuallymalloc(</tt><i>size</i><tt>)</tt> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><tt>calloc(</tt><i>nelem</i><tt>,</tt> <i>elsize</i><tt>)</tt>
             </td>
        <td><tt>actuallycalloc(</tt><i>nelem</i>, <i>elsize</i><tt>)</tt>
             </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><tt>realloc(</tt><i>ptr</i><tt>,</tt> <i>size</i><tt>)</tt> </td>
        <td><tt>actuallyrealloc(</tt><i>ptr</i>, <i>size</i><tt>)</tt> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><tt>free(</tt><i>ptr</i><tt>)</tt> </td>
        <td><tt>actuallyfree(</tt><i>ptr</i><tt>)</tt> </td>
    </tr>
</table>
</center>

<p class="j">
For example, suppose there exists a system library function named
&ldquo;<tt>getimage()</tt>&rdquo;  which reads a raster image file and
returns the address of a buffer  containing it. Since the library
routine allocates the image directly  with <tt>malloc()</tt>, you
can't use SMARTALLOC's <tt>free()</tt>, as  that call expects
information placed in the buffer by SMARTALLOC's  special version of
<tt>malloc()</tt>, and hence would report an error.  To release the
buffer you should call <tt>actuallyfree()</tt>, as in  this code
fragment:
</p>

<pre>
        struct image *ibuf = getimage("ratpack.img");
        display_on_screen(ibuf);
        actuallyfree(ibuf);
</pre>

<p class="j">
Conversely, suppose we are to call a library function,
&ldquo;<tt>putimage()</tt>&rdquo;,  which writes an image buffer into
a file and then releases the buffer  with <tt>free()</tt>. Since the
system <tt>free()</tt> is being called,  we can't pass a buffer
allocated by SMARTALLOC's allocation routines,  as it contains special
information that the system <tt>free()</tt> doesn't expect to be
there. The following code uses <tt>actuallymalloc()</tt> to obtain the
buffer passed to such a routine.
</p>

<pre>
        struct image *obuf = 
           (struct image *) actuallymalloc(sizeof(struct image));
        dump_screen_to_image(obuf);
        putimage("scrdump.img", obuf);  /* putimage() releases obuf */
</pre>

<p class="j">
It's unlikely you'll need any of the &ldquo;actually&rdquo; calls
except  under very odd circumstances (in four products and three
years, I've  only needed them once), but they're there for the rare
occasions that  demand them. Don't use them to subvert the error
checking of  SMARTALLOC; if you want to disable orphaned buffer
detection, use the <tt>sm_static(1)</tt> mechanism described above.
That way you don't forfeit all the other  advantages of SMARTALLOC as
you do when using <tt>actuallymalloc()</tt> and
<tt>actuallyfree()</tt>.
</p>

<h3>SMARTALLOC Details</h3>

<p class="j">
When you include &ldquo;<code>smartall.h</code>&rdquo; and define
SMARTALLOC, the  following standard system library functions are
redefined with the  <code>#define</code> mechanism to call
corresponding functions within <code>smartall.c</code> instead. (For
details of the redefinitions, please refer to 
<code>smartall.h</code>.)
</p>

<pre>
        void *malloc(size_t size)
        void *calloc(size_t nelem, size_t elsize)
        void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)
        void free(void *ptr)
        void cfree(void *ptr)
</pre>

<p class="j">
<tt>cfree()</tt> is a historical artefact identical to <tt>free()</tt>.
</p>

<p class="j">
In addition to allocating storage in the same way as the standard 
library functions, the SMARTALLOC versions expand the buffers they 
allocate to include information that identifies where each buffer was 
allocated and to chain all allocated buffers together. When a buffer
is  released, it is removed from the allocated buffer chain. A call on
<tt>sm_dump()</tt> is able, by scanning the chain of allocated
buffers, to find all  orphaned buffers. Buffers allocated while
<tt>sm_static(1)</tt> is in  effect are specially flagged so that,
despite appearing on the  allocated buffer chain, <tt>sm_dump()</tt>
will not deem them orphans.
</p>

<p class="j">
When a buffer is allocated by <tt>malloc()</tt> or expanded with
<tt>realloc()</tt>,  all bytes of newly allocated storage are set to
the hexadecimal value  0x55 (alternating one and zero bits). Note that
for <tt>realloc()</tt> this applies only to the bytes added at the end
of buffer; the  original contents of the buffer are not modified.
Initialising  allocated storage to a distinctive nonzero pattern is
intended to catch  code that erroneously assumes newly allocated
buffers are cleared to  zero; in fact their contents are random. The
<tt>calloc()</tt> function, defined as returning a buffer cleared to
zero, continues to  zero its buffers under SMARTALLOC.
</p>

<p class="j">
Buffers obtained with the SMARTALLOC functions contain a special 
sentinel byte at the end of the user data area. This byte is set to a 
special key value based upon the buffer's memory address. When the 
buffer is released, the key is tested and if it has been overwritten
an  assertion in the <tt>free</tt> function will fail. This catches
incorrect  program code that stores beyond the storage allocated for
the buffer.  At <tt>free()</tt> time the queue links are also
validated and an  assertion failure will occur if the program has
destroyed them by  storing before the start of the allocated storage.
</p>

<p class="j">
In addition, when a buffer is released with <tt>free()</tt>, its 
contents are immediately destroyed by overwriting them with the 
hexadecimal pattern 0xAA (alternating bits, the one's complement of
the  initial value pattern). This will usually trip up code that keeps
a  pointer to a buffer that's been freed and later attempts to
reference  data within the released buffer. Incredibly, this is
<em>legal</em> in  the standard Unix memory allocation package, which
permits programs to  <code>free()</code> buffers, then raise them from
the grave with <tt>realloc()</tt>.  Such program &ldquo;logic&rdquo;
should be fixed, not accommodated, and  SMARTALLOC brooks no such
&ldquo;<a href="/etexts/www/Bible/John.html#11">Lazarus</a>
buffer&rdquo; nonsense.
</p>

<p class="j">
Some C libraries allow a zero size argument in calls to
<tt>malloc()</tt>.  Since this is far more likely to indicate a
program error than a  defensible programming stratagem, SMARTALLOC
disallows it with an  assertion.
</p>

<p class="j">
When the standard library <tt>realloc()</tt> function is called to 
expand a buffer, it attempts to expand the buffer in place if
possible,  moving it only if necessary. Because SMARTALLOC must place
its own  private storage in the buffer and also to aid in error
detection, its  version of <tt>realloc()</tt> always moves and copies
the buffer except  in the trivial case where the size of the buffer is
not being changed.  By forcing the buffer to move on every call and
destroying the contents  of the old buffer when it is released,
SMARTALLOC traps programs which  keep pointers into a buffer across a
call on <tt>realloc()</tt> which  may move it. This strategy may prove
very costly to programs which make  extensive use of
<tt>realloc()</tt>. If this proves to be a problem,  such programs may
wish to use <tt>actuallymalloc()</tt>, <tt>actuallyrealloc()</tt>, 
and <tt>actuallyfree()</tt> for such frequently-adjusted buffers, 
trading error detection for performance. Although not specified in
the  System V Interface Definition, many C library implementations of
<tt>realloc()</tt> permit an old buffer argument of <code>NULL</code>,
causing <tt>realloc()</tt> to  allocate a new buffer. The SMARTALLOC
version permits this.
</p>

<h3>When SMARTALLOC is Disabled</h3>

<p class="j">
When SMARTALLOC is disabled by compiling a program with the symbol 
SMARTALLOC not defined, calls on the functions otherwise redefined by 
SMARTALLOC go directly to the system functions. In addition, 
compile-time definitions translate calls on the
&ldquo;<tt>actually</tt>&hellip;<tt>()</tt>&rdquo;  functions into the
corresponding library calls;
&ldquo;<tt>actuallymalloc(100)</tt>&rdquo;,  for example, compiles
into &ldquo;<tt>malloc(100)</tt>&rdquo;. The two  special SMARTALLOC
functions, <tt>sm_dump()</tt> and <tt>sm_static()</tt>,  are defined
to generate no code (hence the null statement). Finally, if 
SMARTALLOC is not defined, compilation of the file
<code>smartall.c</code> generates  no code or data at all, effectively
removing it from the program even  if named in the link instructions.
</p>

<p class="j">
Thus, except for unusual circumstances, a program that works with 
SMARTALLOC defined for testing should require no changes when built 
without it for production release.
</p>

<h3>The <code>alloc()</code> Function</h3>

<p class="j">
Many programs I've worked on use very few direct calls to
<tt>malloc()</tt>,  using the identically declared <tt>alloc()</tt>
function instead. The <tt>alloc()</tt> function detects out-of-memory
conditions and aborts, removing the need for  error checking on every
call of <tt>malloc()</tt> (and the temptation  to skip checking for
out-of-memory).
</p>

<p class="j">
As a convenience, SMARTALLOC supplies a compatible version of <tt>alloc()</tt>
in the file <code>alloc.c</code>, with its definition in the file <code>alloc.h</code>. This 
version of <tt>alloc()</tt> is sensitive to the definition of 
SMARTALLOC and cooperates with SMARTALLOC's orphaned buffer detection. 
In addition, when SMARTALLOC is defined and <tt>alloc()</tt> detects an 
out of memory condition, it takes advantage of the SMARTALLOC 
diagnostic information to identify the file and line number of the call 
on <tt>alloc()</tt> that failed.
</p>

<h3>Overlays and Underhandedness</h3>

<p class="j">
String constants in the C language are considered to be static arrays 
of characters accessed through a pointer constant. The arrays are 
potentially writable even though their pointer is a constant. 
SMARTALLOC uses the compile-time definition <tt>__FILE__</tt> to obtain 
the name of the file in which a call on buffer allocation was 
performed. Rather than reserve space in a buffer to save this 
information, SMARTALLOC simply stores the pointer to the compiled-in 
text of the file name. This works fine as long as the program does not 
overlay its data among modules. If data are overlayed, the area of 
memory which contained the file name at the time it was saved in the 
buffer may contain something else entirely when <tt>sm_dump()</tt> gets 
around to using the pointer to edit the file name which allocated the 
buffer.
</p>

<p class="j">
If you want to use SMARTALLOC in a program with overlayed data, you'll 
have to modify <code>smartall.c</code> to either copy the file name to a 
fixed-length field added to the <tt>abufhead</tt> structure, or else 
allocate storage with <tt>malloc()</tt>, copy the file name there, and 
set the <tt>abfname</tt> pointer to that buffer, then remember to 
release the buffer in <tt>sm_free</tt>. Either of these approaches are 
wasteful of storage and time, and should be considered only if there is 
no alternative. Since most initial debugging is done in non-overlayed 
environments, the restrictions on SMARTALLOC with data overlaying may 
never prove a problem. Note that conventional overlaying of code, by 
far the most common form of overlaying, poses no problems for 
SMARTALLOC; you need only be concerned if you're using exotic tools for 
data overlaying on MS-DOS or other address-space-challenged systems.
</p>

<p class="j">
Since a C language &ldquo;constant&rdquo; string can actually be written 
into, most C compilers generate a unique copy of each string used in a 
module, even if the same constant string appears many times. In modules 
that contain many calls on allocation functions, this results in 
substantial wasted storage for the strings that identify the file name. 
If your compiler permits optimisation of multiple occurrences of 
constant strings, enabling this mode will eliminate the overhead for 
these strings. Of course, it's up to you to make sure choosing this 
compiler mode won't wreak havoc on some other part of your program.
</p>

<h3>Test and Demonstration Program</h3>

<p class="j">
A test and demonstration program, <code>smtest.c</code>, is supplied with 
SMARTALLOC. You can build this program with the <code>Makefile</code> included. 
Please refer to the comments in <code>smtest.c</code> and the <code>Makefile</code> for 
information on this program. If you're attempting to use SMARTALLOC on 
a new machine or with a new compiler or operating system, it's a wise 
first step to check it out with <code>smtest</code> first.
</p>

<h3>Invitation to the Hack</h3>

<p class="j">
SMARTALLOC is not intended to be a panacea for storage management 
problems, nor is it universally applicable or effective; it's another 
weapon in the arsenal of the defensive professional programmer 
attempting to create reliable products. It represents the current state 
of evolution of expedient debug code which has been used in several 
commercial software products which have, collectively, sold more than 
third of a million copies in the retail market, and can be expected to 
continue to develop through time as it is applied to ever more 
demanding projects.
</p>

<p class="j">
The version of SMARTALLOC here has been tested on a Sun SPARCStation, 
Silicon Graphics Indigo&sup2;, and on MS-DOS using both Borland and 
Microsoft C. Moving from compiler to compiler requires the usual small 
changes to resolve disputes about prototyping of functions, whether the 
type returned by buffer allocation is <code>char&nbsp;*</code> or <code>void&nbsp;*</code>, 
and so forth, but following those changes it works in a variety of
environments. I hope you'll find SMARTALLOC as useful for 
your projects as I've found it in mine.
