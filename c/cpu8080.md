# cpu8080 #

### This is an 8080 core created as a project to get to know Verilog ###

*The core is fully instruction compatible with 8080, but not signal compatible. The 
original 8080 was a multiplexed nightmare. one of the original selling points of the Z80 
was its cleanup of the signals, and the 8080 itself had a companion chip that 
demultiplexed it.*
