Hi Mike, not sure if you remember me or not.  I'm the guy who made
Passage, Gravitation, Between, and a bunch of other "art" games over the
past year or so.  Maggie was the one who usually covered my work, but
she's gone now, so I'm getting in touch with you instead.


My new game Primrose is a bit of a departure for me.  Instead of setting out to make another art game, I set my sights on one of the gaints---Tetris---and tried my hand at making a game that is as compelling as that.  I came up with a completely novel puzzle mechanic (not a copycat at all) that is also really compelling and deep.  Primrose is the result.

The other interesting thing about Primrose is the online leaderboard:  all posted scores have a PLAY button next to them, and you can watch instant replays of every top-scoring game, right on your iPhone (or Mac, etc.).  Thus, people can learn from each other... it's kind of a huge social experiment, and I don't think it's ever been done before, at least not in the context of a puzzle game.

Primrose is $2.99 on the iPhone, but completely free to download (including source code) on the other platforms, Mac/Win/Linux.  So that's another social experiment in action---selling an open-source iPhone game.  I guess it's like a luxury tax---if you've got an iPhone, you can afford the game, but if not, you can always play the free version on the other platforms.

Oh man... I almost sent this off without the link!
