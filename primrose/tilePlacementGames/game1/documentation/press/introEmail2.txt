Jason Rohrer here... not sure if you've heard of me or not.  I'm the guy who made Passage, Gravitation, Between, and a bunch of other indie "art" games this past year.  You can read about me in the December "genius" issue of Esquire here:

Anyway, my new game, Primrose, was just released on iPhone (plus Win/Mac/Linux).  It's a bit unusual for me, in that it's not an art game, but a compelling puzzle game instead.  It's a very unique design, not quite like anything else that's out there.  I put a lot of work into designing and polishing it, and I'm proud of the result.  IGN just interviewed me about the process of creating the game:

Let me know if you are interested in reviewing Primrose, and I will send you an App Store promo code.

In the mean time, you can take a look at the Primrose website and try the free versions for other platforms (identical to the iPhone version):

Thanks for your time, and enjoy the game!
