Jason Rohrer here... not sure if you've heard of me or not.  I'm the guy who made Passage, Gravitation, Between, and a bunch of other indie "art" games this past year.  You can read about me in the December "genius" issue of Esquire here:

Anyway, my new game, Primrose, is scheduled to come out on the iPhone (plus Win/Mac/Linux) in a few days.  It's a bit unusual for me, in that it's not an art game, but a compelling puzzle game instead.  It's a very unique design, not quite like anything else that's out there.  I put a lot of work into designing and polishing it, and I'm proud of the result.

If you would like me to send you free Ad Hoc builds that you can run on your phones, please send your iPhone UUIDs to me by email.

In the mean time, you can take a look at the Primrose website, which will have more content available soon:

Also, you can download the secret preview builds for Mac or Windows (identical to iPhone version).  Please don't share this link:

Thanks for your time, and enjoy the game!
