INSTALLING GDDCALC
==================

You can either recompile GDDCALC from the source files contained
in gddcalc_vvv_src.zip (where vvv is a version number), or you can
download the compiled binaries. The binaries are in the file
gddcalc_vvv_exe.zip.

gddcalc_vvv_exe.zip contains 4 files (in addition to this readme):

      gddcalc.exe
      gleaves.bmp
      about.bmp
      tutorial.bmp

To install GDDCALC you need only create a directory named gddcalc
and copy these 4 files to it. Nothing further is required.

You might also wish to create a shortcut to gddcalc.exe and place
it on your desktop, to make starting GDDCALC easy.

If you plan to recompile GDDCALC from the source code, either
because the compiled binaries do not work on your machine, or
because you wish to change or extend the program, you have our
blessing; this is open source code, after all. We created the code
and compiled it in the Dev-C++ development environment from
Bloodshed Software and can recommend that environment without
reservation.

GDDCALC's windows all use the font Arial Bold. If for some reason
your computer lacks this font, you should install it.

ABOUT GDDCALC
=============

Creating GDDCALC has been a labor of love. It is offered for
whatever use it may provide in evaluating specific sites in the
Pacific Northwest for grape growing. It focuses *only* on the
temperature aspect of climate. Wind, for example, is not part
of the analysis. (A site that is exposed to frequent, strong,
drying winds is probably not appropriate for grapes.) And
GDDCALC does not, of course, evaluate soil composition or drainage.

As of late 2007 GDDCALC is validated for conditions in and about
western Oregon and southwestern Washington. We think that it will
give reasonable GDD predictions for prospective vineyard sites in
that region, but make no promises, so use it at your own risk.
We do plan in the future to assimilate data from other grape-growing
regions in Washington, and British Columbia. As GDDCALC is validated
for new areas the software will be updated and made available on
the website.

We offer this software with no warranty of any kind, express or
implied.
