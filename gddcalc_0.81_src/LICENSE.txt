Quoted from http://oregonviticulture.net/:

Two versions of GDDCALC have been created, one for Microsoft Windows 
and one for Macintosh. 
Both are available free of charge. 
The software is uncopyrighted and has been placed in the public domain. 
This basically means that you can do what you want with the source 
code and the binaries.
