   Clock24 is the 24-hour analog clock for those programmers who have to
   get their work done before midnight. The short hand travels around in
   a day, whereas those on conventional analog clocks do so in half a
   day. The biggest reasons why I wrote this are that I often write code
   in the basement to find myself not sure whether it's nighttime or
   daytime, and that I prefer analog clocks to digital clocks.

   This program uses OpenGL to draw an analog clock, and GLUT to do UI
   stuff. It works well with X11 utilities like Devil's Pie.

Features

   Compatibility mode(-c)
          Emulates conventional 12-hour analog clock.

   Reverse mode(-r)
          With this option, midnight(0:00) goes to the bottom.

   GMT mode(-g)
          Shows GMT instead of local time.

   Online help(-h)
          Though it lacks man page.

   Alarm
          On the time that the alarm is set, the color of backpanel
          changes to red. It often means that you missed a deadline.

   All these options can also be turned on/off using a pop-up menu.

How to compile

   I checked this program to compile and run on Ubuntu 8.04(AMD64) and
   MacOS X 10.5.4(ppc).
     * On GNU/Linux, make sure you have GLUT and its development files
       installed, and type `make' to get the executable `clock24'. It can
       be put anywhere you like, such as /usr/bin.
     * On Apple MacOS X, type `make -f Makefile.macosx' to use the
       Makefile that I wrote for MacOS X users. Put `clock24' anywhere
       you like.
     * On *BSD, most users tend to know what they are doing. Please
       compile clock24.c, whose object links against GLUT and OpenGL. I
       hear OpenBSD is getting hardware rendering support, with which
       this application runs more smoothly on the platform.
