The new svcSchAlarm system call allows for multiple active alarms for each
process.  An "alarm handle" value is used to identify individual alarm
requests and events.  This is a 32-bit value which is unique for each alarm
created (provided no more than 2^31 alarms are created!).  The svc_schalarm
functions allow for the creation of alarms and for the modification or
removal of existing alarms.  Alarms can be either one-shot or repeating.
A one-shot alarm causes a signal once and is then automatically removed.  A
repeating alarm causes a signal repeatedly at a specified interval until it
is modified or removed.

	long   function;	// Function:
				//   1 = Remove alarm
				//   2 = Set alarm to specified date and
				//	   time
				//   3 = Set alarm to occur once after
				//	   specified interval
				//   4 = Set alarm to occur repeatedly at
				//	   specified interval
	long   handle;		// Alarm handle, -1 means to create a new
				//   alarm
	long   vector;		// Vector number for alarm signal
	time_s datetime;	// Date/time value (if function = 2) or
				//   interval (if function = 3 or 4)
	value = svc_schalarm(function, handle, vector, datetime);

	Value returned is 0 for function 1 if normal.  Value returned is the
	alarm handle (positive value) for functions 2, 3, or 4 if normal.  A
	negative error code is returned if an error occurs.

If the function is 1, the handle argument must indicate an existing alarm.  It
cannot be -1.  For function 1, the vector and datetime arguments are ignored.
For functions 2, 3, or 4, the handle can be -1 to create a new alarm or can
indicate an existing alarm to modify that alarm.  The type, vector, and
datetime value of an existing alarm can all be modified.  If 0 is specified for
the vector or datetime value, the corresponding value is not changed.  When an
alarm is modified (even if no values are changed) the alarm interval is
restarted for functions 3 and 4.  When creating a new alarm, both the vector
and datetime values must be non-zero.  For function 2, the datetime value
specifies an absolute date and time in standard XOS system date-time format.
For functions 3 and 4, the datetime value specifies a time interval as a 64-bit
value which is a binary fraction with a 32-bit whole number part and a 32-bit
fractional part.  This value specifies days.  The maximum interval for an
alarm request is about 1.2 years (2^31 scheduler intervals, which are 20ms
each).  This limit also applies when a date and time are specified as well as
when the interval is specified directly.  There is a global per-process limit
on the number of alarms which can be created.  The default value for this limit
is 16, but it can be changed to any desired value by changing the ALMLIMIT
syschar value.

Only one signal will be queued for each alarm.  This means that if a signal for
a repeated alarm cannot be granted because the process is at a higher signal
level than the level at which the signal is being requested or because the
process is in an uninterruptable wait state, additional signals for that alarm
are suppressed until the orignal signal is granted.  The alarm will continue
to operate, but without any obserable affect until the orignal signal is
granted.

The interval for an alarm will never be less than the interval specified, but
it may be greater.  Alarms are only granted once per scheduler interval (20ms),
so the actual interval used is rounded up to the end of the appropiate
schedular interval.  Additional delays can result if the system is heavily
loaded and the process cannot be scheduled to run immediately.  This means that
an alarm should not be used as a time reference.  In particular, a repeated
alarm should not be counted to determine elapsed time.
