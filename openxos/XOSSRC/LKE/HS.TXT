1  Scope and Field of Application

This standard specifies the volume and file structure of compact read only
optical discs (CDROM) for the interchange of information between users of
information processing systems.

This standard is applicable to CDROM, including those identified in 3 and other
types which may be the subject of future standards.

This standard specifies a set of recorded descriptors which identify:

-- the attributes of the volume and the descriptors recorded on it;

-- the placement of files;

-- the attributes of the files.

Furthermore, this standard specifies record structures intended for use in
the input or output data streams of an application program when such data
streams are required to be organized as a set of records.

This standard also specifies three nested levels of interchange.


2  Conformance

2.1  Conformance of a CDROM

A CDROM shall be in conformance with this standard when all information
recorded on it conforms to the specifications of Section II of this standard.
A statement of conformance shall identify the lowest level of interchange to
which the contents of the CDROM conform.

A prerequisite to such conformance is conformance of the CDROM to a standard
for recording.

4  Definitions

For the purposes of this standard, the following definitions apply:

4.1  Application Program

A program that processes the contents of a file, and may also process selected
attribute data relating to the file or to the volume(s) on which it is
recorded.


NOTE 1:  An application program is a specific class of user, as defined in this
standard.

4.2  Byte

for the purpose of data interchange with another system.

4.12  Record

A sequence of bytes treated as a unit of information.

4.13  Receiving System

An information processing system which can read a file set from a volume set
which has been recorded by another system for the purpose of data interchange.

4.14  Sector

The smallest addressable part of the recorded area on a CDROM that can be
accessed independently of other addressable parts of the recorded area.

4.15  Standard for Recording

A standard that specifies the recording method and the addressing method for
the recordable area of a CDROM.

4.16  User

sectors shall form a consecutive ascending sequence.

Each Logical Sector shall be identified by a unique Logical Sector Number
(LSN). Logical Sector Numbers shall be integers assigned in an ascending
sequence, in order of ascending physical addresses of the constituent sectors,
starting with 0 for the Logical Sector with the lowest physical address which
may contain recorded information.  The numbering shall continue through
successive, if any, Logical Sectors each of which begins with the sector with
the next higher physical address than that of the last sector constituting the
previous Logical Sector.

6.2  Volume Space

Descriptor shall be recorded in the Logical Sector with the next higher LSN
than that of the Logical Sector in which the previous Volume Descriptor is
recorded.  The sequence shall consist of any number of Volume Descriptors
consecutively recorded as follows.


The sequence shall contain at least one Standard File Structure
Volume Descriptor (see ???).  The contents of the fields of any Standard
File Structure Volume Descriptor shall be identical with the contents of the
corresponding fields of all other Standard File Structure Volume Descriptors,

--  there shall be a record in the Path Table which identifies the Root
    directory and its location;

--  the Directory Record describing the Root directory shall be contained

    directory and shall have a Directory Identifier consisting of only a (00)
    byte;

--  the second Directory Record of the Root directory shall describe the parent
    directory for the Root directory, which shall be the Root directory itself,
    for the Root directory and shall have a Directory Identifier consisting of
    only a (01) byte.


For each directory other than the Root directory:

--  there shall be a record in the Path Table which identifies the directory,
    its parent directory and its location;

--  the first Directory Record of the directory shall describe that directory
    and shall have a Directory Identifier consisting of only a (00) byte;

--  the second Directory Record of the directory shall describe the parent
    directory for that directory and shall have a Directory Identifier
    consisting of only a (01) byte.

Different directories may have the same parent directory.  The Directory
Identifier for a directory shall be different than that of all other
directories with the same parent directory.  A hierarchial relationship shall
exist between the Root directory and all other directories:


                     ROOT
                    /    \
                SUB1     SUB2
               /    \
           SUB3
          /

The hierarchy shall consist of a number of levels (i.e. for n levels: level 1,
level 2,...,level n).  The Root shall be the one and only directory at level 1
of the hierarchy.

If a Directory is at level m of the hierarchy, its Parent Directory shall be
at level (m-1).  The Parent Directory of the Root shall be the Root.

NOTE 4:  A Path Table recorded on a volume shall supersede a Path Table
recorded on any lower numbered volume of the volume set not containing the
same value in the Volume Set Size field.

The directory number of a directory shall be the ordinal number of the record
in the Path Table describing that directory.

8.2.1  Order of Path Table Records

The records in a Path Table shall be numbered starting from 1.  They shall be
ordered using a level order traversal, starting with the Root, of the tree
representing the directory hierarchy.  The records shall be ordered as
follows:

-- in ascending order according to level in the directory hierarchy;

-- in ascending order according to Parent Directory Number;

-- in ascending order according to the relative value of Directory Identifier,
   where Directory Identifiers shall be valued as follows:

   +  If the two Directory Identifiers do not contain the same number of byte
      positions, the shorter Directory Identifier shall be treated as if it
      were padded on the right with SPACEs as if both Directory Identifiers
      contained the identical number of byte positions.

   +  After any padding necessary to treat the Directory Identifiers as if
      they were of equal length, the character in the corresponding byte
      positions, starting with the first position, of the Directory 
      Identifiers are compared until a byte position is found that 
      does not contain the same character in both Directory Identifiers.  
      The greater Directory Identifier is the one that contains the character 
      with the higher code position value in the coded character set used to 
      interpret the Directory Identifier field of the Path Table Record.

8.3  Directory

A Directory shall contain a set of records which specify the identification,
location, size and certain attributes of all files for which the Directory is
the parent directory.  A File Identifier for a file in a directory shall be
different than all other File Identifiers in the same directory, unless as
specified for the Associated File bit of the File Flags field of a Directory
Record.

8.3.1  Directory Record

A Directory Record shall contain information used to locate an extent of a
file, file identification, any Extended Attribute Records associated with the
file extent, and certain attributes of the file extent.

The first or only Directory Record recorded in a Logical Sector shall begin at
the first byte of the first Data Field of that Logical Sector.  Each
subsequent Directory Record recorded in that Logical Sector shall begin at the
byte immediately following the last byte of the preceding Directory Record in
that Logical Sector.  Each Directory Record shall end in the Logical Sector in
which it begins.  Unused positions after the last Directory Record in a
Logical Sector shall be set to (00).

8.3.2  Order of Directory Records

The records of a Directory shall be ordered as follows:

-- in ascending order according to the relative value of File Name, where File
   Names shall be valued as follows:

   + If two File Names have the same content in all byte positions, then these
     two File Names are said to be equal in value.

   + If two File Names do not contain the same number of byte positions, the
     shorter File Name shall be treated as if it were padded on the right with
     SPACEs as if both File Names contained the identical number of byte
     positions.

     After any padding necessary to treat the File Names as if they were of
     equal length, the character in the corresponding byte positions, starting
     with the first position, of the File Names are compared until a byte
     position is found that does not contain the same character in both File
     Names.  The greater File Name is the one that contains the character with
     the higher code position value in the coded character set used to 
     interpret the File Name field of the Directory Record.

-- in ascending order according to the relative value of File Name Extension,
   where File Name Extensions shall be valued as follows:

   +  If two File Name Extensions have the same content in all byte positions,
      then these two File Name Extensions are said to be equal in value.

   +  If two File Name Extensions do not contain the same number of byte
      positions, the shorter File Name Extension shall be treated as if it
      were padded on the right with SPACEs as if both File Name Extensions
      contained the identical number of byte positions.

      After any padding necessary to treat the File Name Extensions as if they
      were of equal length, the character in the corresponding byte positions,
      starting with the first position, of the File Name Extensions are
      compared until a byte position is found that does not contain the same
      character in both File Name Extensions.  The greater File Name Extension
      is the one that contains the character with the higher code position
      value in the coded character set used to interpret the File Name
      Extension field of the Directory Record.

-- in descending order according to the relative value of File Version Number,
   where File Version Numbers shall be valued as follows:

   +  If two File Version Numbers have the same content in all byte positions,
      then these two File Version Numbers are said to be equal in value.

   +  If two File Version Numbers do not contain the same number of byte
      positions, the shorter File Version number shall be treated as if it
      were padded on the left with DIGIT ZEROs as if both File Version
      Numbers contained the identical number of byte positions.

      After any padding necessary to treat the File Version Numbers as if they
      were of equal length, the character in the corresponding byte positions,
      starting with the first position, of the File Version Numbers are
      compared until a byte position is found that does not contain the same
      character in both File Version Numbers.  The greater File Version Number
      is the one that contains the character with the higher code position 
      value in the coded character set used to interpret the File Version 
      Number field of the Directory Record.

-- in ascending order according to the value of the Associated File bit of the
   File Flags field.

-- The order of the Directory Records for a file shall specify the order of the
   Logical Blocks in the File Space of the file.

8.3.3 Directory Length

The length of a Directory shall be the sum of:

-- the lengths of all Directory Records described by the Directory;

-- the number of unused positions after the last Directory Record in all
   Logical Sectors in which the Directory is recorded.

8.4  Extended Attributes

Extended Attribute Records may optionally be associated with each Directory
Record.

8.4.1  Extended Attribute Record

If present, Extended Attribute Records shall be recorded beginning with the
first byte of the first Logical Block assigned to the extent described by the
associated Directory Record.
