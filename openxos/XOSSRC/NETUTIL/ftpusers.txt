Version 2.0 of FTPSRV uses UDFSRV for user verification. The users password
;s verified and this home directory is set as the base path used for all
file accesses.  Inorder to log in as an FTP user, the FTP access class must
be set for the user.  Inorder to use all-files mode (which ignores the base
path and allows access to any file on the system), the user must have the
FTPALL allowed privilege.  If the user also has the FTPALL initial privilege,
all-files mode is enabled when he logs in.  Otherwise, he can use the ALLFILES
FTP command (which generates an XAFL FTP protocol command) to toggle the
all-files mode on and off.  If no home directory is specified for the user
he cannot use FTP unless he has the FTPALL privilege.  In this case he is
given a base directory which is the root of the boot disk.

This version of FTPSRV addes the PASSWORD command line argument.  When this
argument is present (without a value), user login with password checking is
enabled.  If it is not present, the user name and password are asked for but
the values are ignored.  All users operate in all-files mode all of the time.
The is approximately the same as the previous version's behavior.


UDFSRV is a specialized database server which reads and updates the XOS
user defscription file (UDF), xxxx.UDF where xxxx name of the user group name
described by the file.  The default group, USER, is used if no user group
is specified.


IMPORTANT:  The password in the UDF is encoded using DES.  It is not clear
IMPORTANT:  if this code can be exported legally.  Since DES is used here
IMPORTANT:  only for verification and not for data encryption, it may be
IMPORTANT:  exportable without a special license, but it is the user's
IMPORTANT:  responsablility to verify this.  The authors make no
IMPORTANT:  representations regarding the exportabity of this code.  The
IMPORTANT:  author's position is that this code is NOT exportable without
IMPORTANT:  an export license.  The software in question is contained in
IMPORTANT:  the files QDES.C and QDESDATA.C in the \XOSSRC\LIBX\ directory.
IMPORTANT:  All other code in this package should be freely exportable.
IMPORTANT:  The QDES routines are used in FTPSRV, UDFSRV, and USEREDIT.


The following programs are used to access and modify the UDF files:

UDFSRV	A server which reads and modifies UDF files.  All access to UDF files
	should use this server.  No other program should directly access the
	UDF files.

USEREDIT  A simple program which allows creation and editing of UDF file
	records.  It access the UDF files using UDFSRV.

MAKEUDF	A program which generates a UDF file from a simple text file.  It is
	mainly intended to be used to create an initial UDF file.

Note that UDFSRV uses the SERVER utility program as a command interface. The
SERVER command interface uses IPM message.  All accesses to the UDF are made
using UDP datagrams.
