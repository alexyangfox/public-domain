The authors and the publisher hold no copyright restrictions

Gems, be retained in all programs that use these files.

The original source files are stored in a plain text format; you

read and use the code).  The updated source files in the "src"
directory should be downloaded using binary transfer mode.

Additional submissions (bug fixes, skeleton programs, auxiliary
routines, etc.) may be directed to the site administrator,
Craig Kolb (cek@cs.princeton.edu).  He will determine on a case-by-case

If accepted, these routines will be made available in a companion 
directory.
