This group of files is a simple demonstration of an anti-aliased line
renderer from _Graphics_Gems_.  Files in the release are:

  00README -- This information file.

  Makefile -- Makefile for creating the demo executable.

  AALines.h -- Include file for demo source files.

  AALines.c -- Rendering code from _Graphics_Gems_ pages 690-693.

  AATables.c -- Initialization code for frame buffer and lookup tables.

  AAMain.c -- Calling routine for the renderer.

  utah.h -- Include file for friendly Utah RLE front end.

  utah.c -- Source for friendly Utah RLE front end.

As it is written, the program dumps its frame buffer to a Utah RLE
file.  You need to obtain the Utah RLE library from another source;
try the following FTP sites:

        cs.utah.edu (128.110.4.21)
        weedeater.math.yale.edu (130.132.23.17)
        freebie.engin.umich.edu (35.2.68.23)

It should be fairly easy to dump the frame buffer to another type
of file, or straight to a display device.  See AAMain.c.

Have fun.
