     dbug.c	 runtime support routines for dbug package

 SCCS

     @(#)dbug.c	1.25	7/25/89

 DESCRIPTION

     These are the runtime support routines for the dbug package.
     The dbug package has two main components; the user include
     file containing various macro definitions, and the runtime
     support routines which are called from the macro expansions.

     Externally visible functions in the runtime support module
     use the naming convention pattern "_db_xx...xx_", thus
     they are unlikely to collide with user defined function names.

     Michael Widenius:
     DBUG_DUMP	- To dump a pice of memory.
     PUSH_FLAG "O"	- To be used insted of "o" if we don't
     		  want flushing (for slow systems)
     PUSH_FLAG "A"	- as 'O', but we will append to the out file instead
     		  of creating a new one.
     Check of malloc on entry/exit (option "S")
