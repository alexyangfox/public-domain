                                      INTRODUCTION
                                      ============


          The TGASAVE functions (hereafter called TGASAVE) make it possible 
          to save TGA-images from your own graphic-producing C-programs.

              TGA is a trademark of Truevision, Inc. TARGA is a registered 
              trademark of Truevision, Inc. 

          TGASAVE creates simple TGA-files following the TGA File Format 2.0 
          standard.

          TGASAVE is hereby dedicated to the Public Domain. Feel free to 
          change the source code as you wish !!!

          I would be very happy if you could mail me if you use this program. 
          Nice to know where my work goes :-)





                                       LIMITATIONS
                                       ===========

          TGASAVE contains no more than what is needed to create uncompressed 
          true color (24 bits per pixel) files, with images stored with 
          pixels starting in the upper left corner. Only a few of the 
          Extension Area fields are supported, but the others can easily be 
          added by changing the source code.

          Uncompressed is not that bad when saving real life photographs, 
          since the Run Length Encoding used in Targa-files doesn't do well 
          on that kind of images.

                                      USING TGASAVE
                                      =============


          TGASAVE consists of five functions, all decleared in TGASAVE.H:

              TGA_SetImageID() sets up the Image ID field of the file. 

              TGA_SetAuthor() lets you specify the person that comitted the 
                  image. 

              TGA_SetSoftwareID() sets the name of the program that produced 
                  the image. 

              TGA_SetAspect() makes it possible to specify the `shape' of the 
                  pixels. 

              TGA_Save() creates and stores TGA-files. It takes parameters 
                  specifying the filename, image size, and a user defined 
                  callback function that is supposed to fetch the pixel 
                  values. 

          Only the last one is needed to create a TGA-file.

          To use these functions, you must create a callback function that 
          will do what is needed to get the pixel values for each point in 
          the image.





                                       PORTABILITY
                                       ===========


          TGASAVE is written using streams only, and all word (16 bits) 
          outputs are split into byte outputs to force the byte swapping 
          required in TGA-files. This should make the functions rather 
          portable.

          File I/O is done through the functions Create(), Write(), 
          WriteByte(), WriteWord(), WriteZeros(), GetFilePos() and Close(). 
          If you want to rewrite TGASAVE to use other file I/O than streams, 
          you need only change theese functions.

                                      THE FUNCTIONS
                                      =============


          TGA_SetImageID() 

                  Function  Sets the text of the Image Id -field in the 
                            header of the TGA-file. 

                    Syntax  void TGA_SetImageID(char *s); 

                   Remarks  This textfield is optional. If you don't want any 
                            Image ID, you need not call this function.

                            The text can contain no more than 255 characters.

                            Call this function with an empty string to clear 
                            any previously set Image ID. 

              Return value  None

          TGA_SetAuthor() 

                  Function  Sets the name of the image author in the 
                            Extension Area of the TGA-file. 

                    Syntax  void TGA_SetAuthor(char *s); 

                   Remarks  This textfield is optional. If you don't want any 
                            author name, you need not call this function.

                            The text can contain no more than 40 characters.

                            Call this function with an empty string to clear 
                            any previously set author.

                            Note that if no part of the Extension Area is 
                            specified, the Extension Area is not written to 
                            the file. 

              Return value  None

          TGA_SetSoftwareID() 

                  Function  Sets the name of the program that created the 
                            image in the Extension Area of the TGA-file. 

                    Syntax  void TGA_SetSoftwareID(char *s); 

                   Remarks  This textfield is optional. If you don't want any 
                            program name, you need not call this function.

                            The text can contain no more than 40 characters.

                            Call this function with an empty string to clear 
                            any previously set Software ID.

                            Note that if no part of the Extension Area is 
                            specified, the Extension Area is not written to 
                            the file. 

              Return value  None

          TGA_SetAspect() 

                  Function  Sets the pixel aspect ratio in the Extension Area 
                            of the TGA-file. 

                    Syntax  void TGA_SetAspect(int width, int height); 

                   Remarks  The aspect ratio specifies the relative width and 
                            height of each pixel. Set width==height for 
                            square pixels.

                            This is optional. If pixel ratio is not 
                            important, you need not call this function.

                            Call this function with zeros to clear any 
                            previously set aspect ratio.

                            Note that if no part of the Extension Area is 
                            specified, the Extension Area is not written to 
                            the file. 

              Return value  None

          TGA_Save() 

                  Function  Creates a new TGA-file, storing required 
                            information along with the image data itself. 

                    Syntax  int TGA_Save(
                                    char *filename,
                                    int width, int height,
                                    void (*getpixel)(int x, int y,
                                                     TGA_Color *col)
                                ); 

                   Remarks  Creates a new (or overwrites an existing) 
                            TGA-file with the given filename. No 
                            .TGA-extension is added, so it should be part of 
                            the string.

                            The width- and height- parameters specify the 
                            size of the image.

                            TGA_Save() obtains the pixel values by calling a 
                            user specified function. This function is passed 
                            in the parameter getpixel. See "THE CALLBACK 
                            FUNCTION" further down for a description of this 
                            function. 

              Return value  TGA_OK          OK
                            TGA_ERRCREATE   Error creating file.
                            TGA_ERRWRITE    Error writing to file.

                                  THE CALLBACK FUNCTION
                                  =====================


          callback() 

                  Function  Obtains pixel-values for the TGA_Save() 
                            -function. 

                    Syntax  void callback(int x, int y, TGA_Color *c); 

                   Remarks  This function (or these functions) must be 
                            written by the programmer using TGASAVE. It 
                            should accept two integer parameters specifying a 
                            point in the image, and a pointer to a 
                            color-structure that must be filled in with the 
                            correct color values (red, green and blue). The 
                            structure has three integer fields, r, g and b.

                            The ranges for these parameters are as follows:

                                x     : [0, img_width - 1]
                                y     : [0, img_height - 1]
                                r,g,b : [0, 255]

                            where img_width and img_height are the values 
                            width and height passed to TGA_Save().

                            Of course callback() need not get its values from 
                            the screen. The values can be fetched from a 
                            memory array, they can be calculated using some 
                            entertaining mathematical function for each point 
                            requested, etc.

                            The function is passed as a parameter to 
                            TGA_Save(), and can thus have any name, not only 
                            callback(). 

              Return value  Nothing directly, but col must be filled in with 
                            color values.
