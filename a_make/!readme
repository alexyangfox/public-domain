This archive contains the source code for PAMAKE, for use under DOS,
OS/2, and VAX VMS.  Please read the documentation and disclaimers in
PAMAKE.DOC before using these files.

The executable versions of the PAMAKE program are supplied free with 
Roundhill's PANEL Plus screen manager.  If you have the executable 
programs, you will be able to use them to rebuild modified versions 
of themseleves.  If you do not have the executable version, you will 
simply have to take the provided make files apart and work out what 
to do.  It is not very hard - you just compile and link together 
everything you find in this archive.
