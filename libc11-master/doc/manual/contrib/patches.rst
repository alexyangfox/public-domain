Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

* Do your best to adhere to the existing :doc:`coding conventions <style>`
  and idioms.
* Don't use hard tabs, and don't leave trailing whitespace on any line.
  Before committing, run ``git diff --check`` to make sure of this.
* Do document every function you add using `Doxygen`_ annotations.
  Read the `tutorial`_ or just look at the existing code for examples.
* Don't touch the `VERSION` file. If you need to change it, do so on your
  private branch only.
* Do feel free to add yourself to the `CREDITS` file and the corresponding
  list in the the `README`. Alphabetical order applies.
* Don't touch the `AUTHORS` file. If your contributions are significant
  enough, be assured we will eventually add you in there.
