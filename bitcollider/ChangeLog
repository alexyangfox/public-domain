Changes to version 0.6.0:
-------------------------
- Tiger tree definition changed, incompatible with previous releases.
- Added video plugin. (delirium)

Changes to version 0.4.0:
-------------------------
- Added support for calculating eDonkey "ed2k" and FastTrack "sig2dat"
  identifiers.
- Added support for PNG images to the image plugin. (delirium)
- Turned off calculating/reporting MD5 hashes by default.

Changes to version 0.3.4:
-------------------------
- Changed the character set used for Base32 encoding and added a . between
  the sha1 and tigertree hash

Changes to version 0.3.3:
-------------------------
- Added support for calculating MD5 hashes.

Changes to version 0.3.2:
-------------------------
- A new image plugin as been added. This image plugin was written
  by Bitizen delirium and supports GIF, BMP and JPG files)
- ID3v2 genres were being reported as strings and not as numeric ID3v1 
  equivalents. Now all ID3v2 genres that map to ID3v1 genres should
  work ok.
- fixed bug where an extra semi-colon would cause an if-block to always
  execute and sometimes crash.
- fixed an incorrect detect sha1 presence line of code (valid sha1s
  may start with a \0 (DUH!)
- Started using libltdl for dynamic loading, thus making the bitcollider
  more cross-platform compatible
- Applied Nathan Lutchansky -f patch (with some debugging to handle
  single file submits correctly), which also sends debugging printfs
  to stderr, not stdout
- Converted bitcollider to use new base32 encoding, rather than base16
- Adapted bitprinting code from the bitprint.[ch] for more modular
  bitprintint capabilities.
- Now using a word64 type to calculate the progress indicator -- this
  should fix the funky progress indicator for large files.
- Fixed a problem where the bitcollider could not traverse compressed directory
  trees. (Thanks to Scott Hernandez for catching this)
- Fixed the windows shell extension to allow bitprinting of a large
  number of files.
