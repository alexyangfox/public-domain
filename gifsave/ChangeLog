	* Version: 1.0.1

	* Created a more `Unix-friendly' distribution: Removed all '\r'
	from end of lines, renamed Borland (DOS/Windows compiler maker)
	specific files, and made a new Makefile and example file.

	* Small changes to comments and spacing to match the look I prefer
	now. Note that I have not tested that the Borland specific
	file still compile.
