2000 August 29

Added _WIN32 code to xd.c to set input and output text/binary
modes and force modes of standard input and output depending on
the operation being performed.  Input is set to binary except
when a "-l" option load is selected, in which case the input
file is text mode and the output is binary.

Remade logo using Snap ITC font as before, changing background
colour to be white as used in the updated HTML file.  Note that
due to an error in this font's bounding box calculation one
must prefix "XD" with a space to avoid truncation of the left
part of the "X".
