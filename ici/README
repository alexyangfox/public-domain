ICI is a general purpose interpretive programming language that has dynamic
typing and flexible data types with the flow control constructs and operators
of C.  It is designed for use in many environments, including embedded
systems, as an adjunct to other programs, as a text-based interface to
compiled libraries, and as a cross-platform scripting language with good
string-handling capabilities.

The ICI language and source is not copyright in any way.

The ici man pages are quite complete and reasonably lengthy.  There is
also a technical document describing the language (ici.pdf in the
doc directory). The ICI Technical Description is copyrighted
but may be used for any purpose as long as its copyright notice
is retained. All other documents are in the public domain unless
otherwise noted.
