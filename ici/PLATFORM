This file documents platform specific features or mis-features.

* FreeBSD

To have "make depend" work correctly bsd.prog.mk requires the Makefile be
called "Makefile" (or "makefile").  Either link, copy or rename Makefile.bsd
as appropriate (a link is the preferred method).


* Linux

* Solaris

flock() is not supported as it is a BSD-thing and only provided by
the SunOS 4.x compatibility libraries.

* Windows

* BeOS
