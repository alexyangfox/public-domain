<A NAME="intro">
<H2>Introduction</H2>
</A>
    The ICI core is designed to build simply and easily on most
    platforms. This description deals with building the ICI core
    itself. The extension modules are in a seperate package.
<P ALIGN="left">
    The build process makes two things:<OL>
        <LI> The core run-time that can be used to run ICI scripts
             from the command line (or loaded dynamically by other
             programs).
        <LI> A software development kit (SDK) which can be used
             to write extension modules (or use ICI as an
             extension to another program).
    </OL>
    For each target configurtion (typically a platform flavour)
    a different configuration include file is made by copying
    the closest exisiting one, and adjusting. Each of these files
    is called <I>conf-xxx.h</I> where <I>xxx</I> is the "flavour".
    There is typically also a <I>Makefile.xxx</I> to match each of these.
    (For Windows there is also a Visual C workspace.)
<P ALIGN="left">
    The file ici.h is the main include file for both seperately
    compiled extension
    modules and programs invoking the ICI interpreter. It is
    made by the build process specificly for each different flavour.
    (Actually, it is made by an ICI script, <I>mk-ici-h.ici</I>,
    so you <I>must</I>
    successfully build ICI before you can make ici.h.)
<P ALIGN="left">
    The following table summarises some of the standard configurations
    for which configuration includes and Makefiles are included
    in the ICI source. Building on these platforms should be
    reasonably straightforward.

<A NAME="supported">
<H2>Building ICI for a supported UNIX-like platform</H2>
</A>
    Building ICI for a supported platform is easy. Simply decide what
    machine you're on and do a <I>make -f Makefile.$MACHINE</I> (where you
    replace <I>$MACHINE</I> with the name)
    to create the library <I>lib$MACHINE.a</I>
    and the interpreter <I>ici.$MACHINE</I>. For example under SunOS 4.1 we use
    the name "sun" and <I>Makefile.sun</I> to build <I>libsun.a</I>
    and <I>ici.sun</I>. Under
    NeXTSTEP we use <I>Makefile.next</I> etc... To see the list of supported
    systems it suffices to see what configuration files exist, these files
    have names in the form <I>conf-$MACHINE.</I>h.
<P ALIGN="left">
    To install the interpreter use <I>make -f Makefile.$MACHINE install</I>. This
    installs the interpreter, library, manual pages, documentation, header
    and startup files. See the Makefiles for details.

ICI would usually be install in /usr/local. From that base,
the following forms a core run-time installation:

<A NAME="ICI_on_Windows">
<H2>ICI on Microsoft Windows</H2>
</A>
    On Windows platforms (any Win32 varient), ICI is compiled into
    a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) called <I>ici4.dll</I>. A definition file
    (<I>ici.def</I>) is used to specify which identifiers should be
    externally visible to other programs. The DLL is linked to use
    multi-threaded DLL based run-time libraries.
<P ALIGN="left">
    There is a Makefile.w32 that can be used to build ICI
    from the command line using Microsoft Visual C. However, this
    is no longer used much. A Visual C workspace is located in
    the win32 sub-directory. See README.txt in that directory for
    details.
<P ALIGN="left">
    Applications may use the ICI DLL as a run-time component by
    including the library file <I>ici4.lib</I> in their build
    (<I>ici4.lib</I> is
    produced as a side-effect of the build of <I>ici4.dll</I>) and,
    of course, including relevent include files.
<P ALIGN="left">
    Two other programs,
    <I>ici.exe</I> and <I>iciw.exe</I> are also built. They are just simple
    stubs to invoke the DLL. The first (<I>ici.exe</I>) is a console
    application, the second (<I>iciw.exe</I>) is a window application.
    They both take command line arguments, but <I>iciw.exe</I> does not
    support wild-card expansion.
<P ALIGN="left">
    If iciw.exe is copied to another file name, say xxx.exe, and
    the file xxx.ici exists in the same directory,
    xxx.ici will be inserted as the first argument
    as if it had been provided on the command line. This is a
    kludge to alleviate the lack of #! support under Windows.

<A NAME="ICI_on_BSD">
<H2>ICI on BSD Unix</H2>
</A>
    The BSD configuration of ICI is intended to be portable to
    all major variants of BSD 4.4 - FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, BSDi
    and Darwin (Mac OS X). Not all these platforms have been tested
    although no major problems are expected.
<P ALIGN="left">
    Individual BSD variants require somewhat different build
    methods, essentially different invoccations of make(1) to
    work around differences in the implementation of the
    <TT>bsd.prog.mk</TT> include file. The reference
    platform is FreeBSD on which a simple <TT>make</TT> suffices
    to build the interpreter and a <TT>make install</TT> to install
    it.  On other systems extra command line arguments may be required.

<A NAME="Configuration">
<H2>Configuration</H2>
</A>
    The distributed makefiles build the interpreter with the default
    configuration for that system. The configuration is controlled by the
    system's <I>conf-$MACHINE.h</I> file. A configuration defines which language
    extensions (collections of builtin functions) are included in the
    build and overcomes some portability concerns. The file <I>conf-sample.h</I>
    contains a prototype configuration.

<A NAME="Config_change">
<H3>Changing the configuration</H3>
</A>
    To change the configuration you edit the system's `conf-xxx.h' header file
    and define or undefine macros to include/exclude features. The default
    macros are listed below. Defining the macro REMOVES the feature from
    the build (which is why the names all start with "NO"). The macros
    are:
<DL>
    <DT>NOMATH<DD>
            Don't include mathematical builtins such as the
            trigonometric functions etc... This is useful
            on small or embedded systems that do not require
            these. On most hosted environments (i.e. those
            with a real OS) it is better to leave these in
            as you'll want them one day.

    <DT>NOWIN<DD>
            Don't include the ICI text windowing functions
            (the code in win.c). ICI's text windowing provides
            a simple curses-like environment (but faster and
            smaller). There is some documentation in the ICI
            manual page and the source of course.

    <DT>NODB<DD>
            Obsolete. Previous versions of ICI supported a
            text file database package which is no longer
            included. This name used to control its inclusion.

    <DT>NOTRACE<DD>
            Don't include the trace() function or its support
            code. This function was an attempt to include some
            kind of debug tracing in ICI but isn't all that
            useful.

    <DT>NOWAITFOR<DD>
            Don't include the waitfor() function. Useful for
            systems that don't implement BSD's select().

    <DT>NOPIPES<DD>
            Don't include pipe support (popen etc.. in clib.c).
            This is used on systems such as MS-DOS that don't
            provide this.

    <DT>NOSKT<DD>
            Obsolete. Previous versions of ICI included BSD sockets
            functions in the core. They have now moved to the net
            extension module.
            
    <DT>NOSYSCALL<DD>
            Obsolete. Previous versions of ICI included Unix-style
            function in the core. They have now moved to the sys
            extension module.

    <DT>NODIR<DD>
            Don't include the dir() function.

    <DT>NOPASSWD<DD>
            Don't include the Unix password file access
            function.

    <DT>NOSTARTUPFILE<DD>
            Don't look for a startup file or provide the
            -s switch to stop that behaviour.

    <DT>NODEBUGGING<DD>
            Don't include the debugging hooks. This may be
            used to avoid including the debug code and its
            tests in the execution loop. Might be useful
            if performance is an issue.

    <DT>ICI_RAND_IS_C_RAND<DD>
            If this is defined then ICI's rand() function
            will be implemented via the C library rand()
            function otherwise ICI uses its own generator
            function.

    <DT>NOEVENTS<DD>
            Don't include the event processing framework, see
            events.c.

    <DT>NOPROFILE<DD>
            Don't include the profiling support, see profile.c
            and profile.h.
</DL>

<A NAME="ICI_extensions">
<H2>General notes on building ICI and extensions</H2>
</A>
    For all systems except MS Windows (for which it is optional),
    for both ICI main code
    builds and extension builds, the preprocessor define
    <A NAME="CONFIG_FILE"><I>CONFIG_FILE</I></A>
    must be defined to be the name
    of the ICI configuration file which is specific to the
    target. The defined value should include double
    quotes around the name. For example:
    <P ALIGN="left">
    <CODE>"conf-sun.h"<BR></CODE>
    is the file used by SunOS, and this would be defined on
    the command line or in the project settings with:<BR>
    <CODE>-DCONFIG_FILE=\"conf-w32.h\"</CODE>

<A NAME="ICI_as_extension">
<H2>ICI as an extension</H2>
</A>
    We are concerned here with the case where ICI does not
    supply the main entry point, but is invoked from other
    code.
    There are a number build issues involved with this.
<P ALIGN="left">
    Firstly, every one of your source files that references some
    ICI items must include <I>fwd.h</I> from the ICI source directory,
    and possibly other includes. It is almost essential that
    the include search path, for those source files at least,
    has the ICI source directory on it.
<P ALIGN="left">
    Secondly, those same source files may need to be primed with the
    definition of the current platform's ICI configuration include
    file (CONFIG_FILE). See the note on
    <A HREF="#CONFIG_FILE">CONFIG_FILE</A>
    defines.
