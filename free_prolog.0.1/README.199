Full BinProlog 1.99 sources (my C and Prolog code as back in 1992-93) are
now in the public domain and available at

 http://clement.info.umoncton.ca/BinProlog/free_bp199.tar.gz

Although this is an integer-only, very small (about 3500 lines
of C and 3700 lines of Prolog) engine known to compile with gcc
(37K executable on Solaris!), it is quite fast (within 30% of
emulated SICStus) and reliable.

The compiler is able to compile its Prolog sources to BinWAM code (a
compact and efficient continuation passing Prolog abstract machine)
in a few seconds on today's PCs and Unix workstations.

Although unsupported, I hope that the released code will be usable
for educational purposes, in C/C++ applications requiring an
embedded logic engine or as a starting point for something like a
new Java-based Prolog system counting on extensive JIT acceleration.

Enjoy,

Paul Tarau

P.S. For pricing information on industrial and academic source and binary
licensing of BinProlog 5.75, an Internet ready and Java connected
Prolog system with ability to generate fast standalone applications
through compilation to C on Windows 95/NT and Unix platforms, see:

BinProlog 5.75 licenses come with 1 year of free updates and support.
