Hapy building and installation instructions:

	% ./configure
	% make
	% make check
	# make install

With default ./configure setting,
	- Hapy library is installed in /usr/local/lib/
	- Hapy header files are installed in /usr/local/include/Hapy/

The "make check" step is optional. It builds a small test suite and executes
test cases to check basic functionality. If any of the test cases fails,
please proceed with caution and notify developers as you may have hit an
unknown compatibility bug.

See http://hapy.org for support options.
