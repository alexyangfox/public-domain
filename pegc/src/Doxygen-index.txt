/** @mainpage WanderingHorse.net C libs

This is the main doxygen index for a few different APIs. See the Pages
links for the specific APIs.

A summary of the libs:

- vappendf is a family of generic printf-like for sending formatted
output to arbitrary destinations.

- whclob is an API for working with dynamically-resizable character data,
most useful for creating strings dynamically and managing their memory.

- whhash is a hashtable implementation.

- whgc is a "sort of" garbage collection library based off of whhash.

- whrc is a small reference counting garbage collector based off of
whhash.

- pegc is an experimental library for creating PEG-style parsers via C
code.

Some of the driving principals of this code:

- Each API/library is specialized for a single category of operations.

- Dependencies between the APIs is kept to a minimum, to allow easier
copying of the libs into arbitrary source trees.

- API documentation is fairly stringent. i'm a stickler for good API
docs.
