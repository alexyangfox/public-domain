Compiling:
Each architecture that the software is compiled on needs a corresponding 
 'tipodef.h' (type definitions).

Included are x86 and AMD64 (they may be used for simlar 32 and 64 bit systems).

Specify which in Makefile : arci=x86,amd64

(libsospesisfada: needs change to yasm -elf32/-elf64 in Makefile if using assembly memory copy.)

Running the test script in c/cpu_1664/ASID (sh proba_asid) will compile and install all 
 libs and the ASID program.
