BALZ v1.15

BALZ is a command-line file compressor with a high compression ratio and fast
decompression.

USAGE
To compress "book1" in normal compression mode:

  balz e book1 book1.balz

To decompress:

  balz d book1.balz book1

Additionally, BALZ has a maximum compression mode that provides higher
compression at the cost of some extra compression time. Note that the
compression mode does not affect decompression time or memory usage.

To compress "book1" in maximum compression mode:

  balz ex book1 book1.balz
