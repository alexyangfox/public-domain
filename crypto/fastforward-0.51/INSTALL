Like any other piece of software (and information generally),
fastforward comes with NO WARRANTY.


Things you have to decide before starting:

* Where qmail is installed, normally /var/qmail. (To change this
directory, edit conf-qmail now.)


How to install:

 1. Create and install the programs and man pages:
       # make setup check

 2. To configure qmail to use /etc/aliases, see ALIASES.


That's it! To report success:
       % ( echo 'First M. Last'; cat `cat SYSDEPS` ) | mail djb-qst@cr.yp.to
Replace First M. Last with your name.
