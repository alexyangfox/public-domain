Like any other piece of software (and information generally),
dot-forward comes with NO WARRANTY.


Things you have to decide before starting:

* The location of the qmail home directory, normally /var/qmail. (To
change this directory, edit conf-qmail now.)


How to install:

 1. Create and install the programs and man pages:
       # make setup check

 2. With qmail 1.02 and above: To set up .forward handling for all
    users, install a /var/qmail/rc script that invokes dot-forward.
    Several scripts are supplied in /var/qmail/boot/*+df.


That's it! To report success:
       % ( echo 'First M. Last'; cat `cat SYSDEPS` ) | mail djb-qst@cr.yp.to
Replace First M. Last with your name.
