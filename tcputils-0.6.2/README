WHAT IS THIS?

This is version 0.6 of tcputils, a collection of programs to
facilitate TCP programming in shell-scripts.  There is also a
small library which makes it somewhat easier to create TCP/IP
sockets.

The latest released version can be found by anonymous FTP to
	ftp.lysator.liu.se:pub/unix/tcputils/
(or at URL:ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/unix/tcputils/ if you
like that syntax better).
I myself can be reached by email to bellman@lysator.liu.se.


The programs included in this release are:

    mini-inetd	- small TCP/IP connection dispatcher
    tcpbug	- TCP/IP connection bugging device
    tcpconnect	- general TCP/IP client
    tcplisten	- general TCP/IP server
    getpeername	- get name of connected TCP/IP peer

You're kidding?  You use it, you take the responsibility.
