REQUIREMENTS

You need an ANSI C compiler.  Gcc is a nice one that exists for
most platforms.

You need GNU make in order to compile.  I think it's too much
work to handle all other make variants with their limitations and
idiosyncrasies.  GNU make compiles on almost any Unix machine.
If it doesn't compile on your machine, then my programs probably
won't compile either anyway...



TO COMPILE

Edit Makefile as needed.  Type "make" and wait a minute or two.



TO INSTALL

Type "make install".
