
ctags - first cut at a UNIX ctags re-implementation


This is a public domain rewrite of the standard UNIX ctags command.
It is a simplified version written primarily for use with the 'stevie'
editor. The command line syntax is:

	ctags [file ...]

Ctags scans the all files given on the command line. If no files are
given, the standard input is scanned for a list of file names.

Function declarations and macros are supported. However, only simple
forms of each are recognized. Functions must be of the following form:

type
fname(...)

where "fname" is the name of the function and must come at the beginning
of a line. This is the form I always use, so the limitation doesn't
bother me.

Macros (with or without parameters) of the following form are also detected:

"#" [white space] "define" [white space] NAME

The white space between the "#" and "define" is optional.


Other Limitations and Changes

No sorting or detection of duplicate functions is done.
