STEVIE Source and OS/2 Executable Release - 3.69grr

This is a source release of the STEVIE editor, a public domain clone
of the UNIX editor 'vi'. The program was originally developed for the
Atari ST, but has been ported to UNIX, OS/2, DOS, and Minix-ST as well.
Ports done by others, but not directly supported by this release, include
Minix-PC, Amiga, and a Data General system of some sort.

The good news about stevie is that it is extremely portable. It supports
systems with virtually all combinations of integer size, pointer size,
and byte order. The only major issue remaining, for some environments,
is that the file is kept in memory. For most environments, this isn't a
problem, but for Minix-PC it is particularly annoying.

Some advantages of Stevie over other versions/clones of 'vi' are:
   -	Built-in help facility.
   -	Tag stacking (for users of CTAGS).
   -	Extensive system-specific features (e.g.- the MSDOS version
   	supports function keys, cursor keys, colors, 43-line mode;
   	the stubs are there to add such support to other systems.)
   -	You have the source code.

To compile STEVIE for one of the provided systems (it is currently set
up for OS/2 and MSC 6.00):

	1. Edit the file 'env.h' to set the system defines as needed.

	2. Check the makefile for your system, and modify as needed.

	3. Compile.

Otherwise, just use the included OS/2 protected-mode executable.  It
will run in windowed or full-screen sessions, but it has not been made
into a bound executable (i.e., will not run under DOS).

Good Luck...
