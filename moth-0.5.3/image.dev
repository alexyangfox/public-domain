AXES

  Image currently only have 4 axes, which we create for every image.



LAYOUT

  Layout areas are:

  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  |                                  title                                   |
  |                                top axis                                  |
  |       +----------------------------------------------------------+       |
  |  left |                                                          | right |
  |  axis |                         canvas                           | axis  |
  |       +----------------------------------------------------------+       |
  |                               bottom axis                                |
  |                                 legend                                   |
  +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  The image is layed out using the cartesian coordinates (left-bottom is
  origin) in unsigned integers.

  The tricky thing about the layout is it that the size of the various
  components of the layout depends on the "size-type" attribute:
    - we need to know the "size-type" to determine the canvas width
    - we need to know the canvas width to know the legend height (because of
      text wrapping)
    - we need to know the legend height and "size-type" to find the canvas
      height

  We also will include a spacer between elements, but only if they're both
  drawn.

  Each layout element has an optional string, which also has a width and
  height.



LEGEND

  The legend is made of the color swatches and titles of the drawing layers.
  We reuse the _layout_element_s structure since it has all the info we need.

  We use an array to manage the legend swatches since we don't layout the image
  until we're ready to draw it, at which point it's too late to add more
  layers.
  


COLORS

  An image also implements a bit of the "color store" interface, since each
  image should have it's own set of colors.  This interface is implemented in
  terms of an actual color store, so it's actually more like direct
  inheritance.



COORDINATE SYSTEMS

  The image has two different types of coordinate systems.  It's default
  coordinate system is similar to the "cartesian" coordinate system.  The
  origin is located at the bottom left of the image, the X axis runs positive
  to the right, and the Y axis runs positive up.  This coordinate system can
  be thought of as the "pixel" coordinate system, since pixels are drawn one
  unit away from each other.  Whole values in this system specify the -center-
  of the pixel.

  A "virtual" coordinate system can be set using the viewport functions.  This
  is the coordinate system used to draw values to the canvas.  The <image>
  object uses the default coordinate system to draw the title and legend, for
  example, and then sets up the viewport for the canvas before the layer code
  creates the datastructures to be drawn.  The layer code uses the 
  _get_viewport_value() function to translate it's values from the virtual
  coordinate system to the pixel coordinate system.
