Moth is an application to create 2 dimensional graphs from various data
sources.  The first version can read data from textfiles, rrd files, and mysql
databases.  Graph definitions are given in XML.  It is also intended to be a
framework for programmers to experiement with data presentation ideas.



GOALS

  - graph description in XML
  - 2-dimensional
  - axes can run in either direction  (not first release)
  - x/y axis labels
  - many different data sources
  - new data sources can be made using calculations on other data sources
  - generate many different image formats
  - made out of a bunch of different layers, drawn in order defined
    - lines
    - areas
    - points
    - x/y grid lines
  - scaling
    - linear
    - logarithmic
    - automatic  (not first release)
  - colors
  - handy shortcuts for easy common graph generation

  - written in C w/portability in mind
  - decent speed  (not highest goal, but important)
  - well documented code to encourage hacking
