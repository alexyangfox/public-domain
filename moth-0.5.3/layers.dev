A layer is a set of marks on the canvas.  They are drawn in the order defined
in the XML file.  In this sense, then can be thought of as "layering" on top of
each other, and thus the name :)

When drawing a layer, all columns are iterated over row-by-row, taking one
value from each column.  Lines and points iterate over two columns (for the
point along the x and y axes), areas and segments iterate over four columns
(for a lower and upper value of both x and y axes), and a grid does no iterate
over any columns.  It draws vertical and horizontal lines at regular intervals
along the specified axes.

A swatch for a layer occurs in the legend only if the layer has a title.

The layers are managed as a linked list, where the first layer acts as a handle
to the entire list.

When it comes time to draw the layer, the viewport of the pixmap has already
been set, so the values from the columns can be used directly, and will be
translated by the pixmap into the correct location.
