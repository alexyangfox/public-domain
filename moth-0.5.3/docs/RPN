REVERSE POLISH NOTATION

  whitespaces separate tokens

  all calculations are done in doubles
  they can including all unit specifiers

  function names are all UPPERCASE

  tokens that aren't comprised of letters or numbers,
  and not specified below, are reserved for future use

  anything else is interpreted as column names

  commenting can be done using the XML comment
  delimiters, <!-- and -->

  functions pop all of their arguments, and don't push
  them back onto the stack unless indicated



IGNORED TOKENS

  you may use these however you choose
  they DO NOT specify subexpressions

  x SIGN        pushes -1.0 if x<0, 0.0 if x is zero, otherwise 1.0
  x y COPYSIGN  pushes back y with the same sign as x
