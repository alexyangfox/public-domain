The coding style for Moth is roughly based on the coding style documented for
perl6, defined here:

  http://dev.perl.org/perl6/pdd/pdd07_codingstd.html.

Note especially the ".dev" files, which accompany ".c" files and describe
the programming concepts and approaches used.


'configure.in' contains the rules used to build the 'configure' script (by
autoconf).
