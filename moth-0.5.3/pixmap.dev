A pixmap contains all the pixels for a pixmap format, and has functions to draw
strutures given in the vector API into the pixels.  It uses the libart_lgpl
library for drawing shapes, and the freetype2 library for drawing text.

The pixmap is given formating structures that use the "pixel" (or "cartesian")
coordinate system described in image.dev.  Libart_lgpl, though, uses a slightly
different system.  The y axis is flipped, with the origin at the top left.
(This is a common coordinate system used for drawing to computer screens, for
example.)

A moth_pixmap_string represents the geometry of a string in the default
coordinate system of the pixmap.
