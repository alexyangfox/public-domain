IDEAS (good and bad) for future releases


  - install using 'make install'

  - make it so that XML can occur inside sources

  - <image font> attribute:  font to use for all text elements (unless changed)

  - maybe change <image width height size-type> attributes to 
    <image canvas-width canvas-height> xor <image width height>

  - "title-color", "title-font", and "title-size" attributes where there is a "title"
    attribute  (<image>, <axis>, and layers)

  - refactor <image> layout to use screen coordinates
    justification:  universal (used by all output formats), just as arbitrary,
    and will simplify code

  - include a (nice) compiled-in font or fonts ?

  - <axis> can run in either direction

  - "auto" scaling in <axis>

  - multiple <axis> on each side

  - "auto" <label> that chooses intelligent tick intervals/templates

  - <label ticks="off"> to show text but not ticks

  - shortcuts  (basically predefined macros for common tasks)

  - argument --dump-xml prints back interpretted XML (for XML default/shortcut debugging)

  - argument --dump-columns prints values in columns (for data debugging)  [sources]

  - argument --profile to print times required to run the sources  [sources]

  - argument --xml-relative  to cause filenames to be calculated relative to
    the location of the XML file  (as opposed to the current working directory)

  - documentation:  man page, HTML docs, --help argument

  - "auto" <grid>

  - dashes in <grid>  (much code already there)

  - dashes in <line>

  - draw <line> continuously, instead of series of line segments

  - draw <area> continuously, instead of series of areas

  - auto-select distinct colors for layers (layers.c)

  - invent logarithmic datetime scale

  - in <rpn>, maybe some way of obtaining the min and max of a column
    (and sum, and average, and standard deviation)

  - in <rpn>, maybe some way of obtaining the min and max of an <axis>

  - in <rpn>, maybe some way of obtaining canvas width and height, and
    maybe units/pixel

  ? allow <rpn> to change configuration values, such as colors

  - variables in <rpn> (that persist across rows)

  - RPN columns

  - some kinda cascading style sheets
    (use sablotron?)

  - <binaryfile> source

  - some kinda source for reading standard map file formats

  - support more output formats, such as dvi, eps, pdf, svg, swf

  - refactor drawing algorithm to support future funky output
    (abstracts:  create image, start data, draw line/grid/&c, stop data, &c)

  - funky dynamic/interactive svg/swf output algorithm

  - maybe redefine formats to use XML tags, so that format-specific attributes
    can be used

  - better recovery when die()ing
    - during <moth> skips to the next <moth>
    - during a source skips to the next <moth>
    - during an output format skips to the next format
    - inside an <image> skips to the next <image>
    (If we had exceptions, this would be very easy.)

  - warn() and die() use stack space, for better error handling in low memory conditions
