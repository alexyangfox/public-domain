Axes is the plural of axis.



AXES

  The <axis> object contains a list of columns with which it is associated
  (through the use of the drawing layers).  These columns are used to calculate
  the minimum and maximum values of the range that the <axis> represents.

  Line and text color for <axis> default to "black".



LABELS

  The <label>s attached to an <axis> are managed through a linked list.  The
  linked list is created in the order that the <label>s are encountered.  This
  means that we add each <label> to the end of the linked list.

  A <label> presents a series of ticks at certain values along the <axis>.

  A <label> contains a template, which describes how the value is drawn,
  similar to printf().

  When processing each <label>, we tokenize the elements of the template, so
  that we know which parts to replace and how.

  The state machine used to tokenize the template (in
  moth_label_tokens_create()) is a little hairy.  For some types of tokens, we
  don't know that the token is complete until we come across the first
  character of the next token.  Many things complicate the state machine:

    - the token length is unknown because of width and precision specifiers
    - the token length is unknown because of the optional 'b' and 'd' modifiers
    - the acceptable units depends on the modifier (or lack of one)
    - the 'd' modifier is also a normal decimal unit
    - '%' specifies a replaceable token, but '%%' is a constant token
      '%%%' is an error



LABEL TICKS

  A tick is the string that occurs at a particular point along the <axis>.

  They are managed as linked lists inside each <axis>.
