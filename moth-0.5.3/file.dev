The moth_file object contains the C data structures that represent the XML in
the file.  It uses a moth_parser object to parse the XML.  It stores the images
and data sources, as well as the column store.

There is one moth_file object created for each file.  This is done in moth.c.

There is one function defined that is not associated with the moth_file
objects.  It is used to interpret file names based on the "xml-relative"
option.
