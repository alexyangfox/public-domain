Execution starts here, in the main() function.

The global runtime structure is created, commandline arguments are processed,
and cleanup is done.  The runtime structure is defined in "data.h".

Note that many commandline arguments have equivalent attributes to <moth>.
Since we process the commandline arguments first, this means that they'll be
overridden by those attributes.

The XML files and arguments are interpetted in the order that they are
encountered.  This is so that the runtime can be changed for XML file on the
commandline.  For example...

  moth --dump-xml first.xml --no-dump-xml second.xml

... will dump the XML for the first file but not the second.
