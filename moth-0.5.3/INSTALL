Installation is only somewhat automated at this time.


step 1)

  Type 'sh configure'

  This should find all required and optional libraries used by moth.
  Configure may have trouble finding the libart_lgpl library, which is
  required.  (On RedHat 7.x systems, it's installed as part of the
  gnome-libs-devel rpm, but can be installed separately if you choose.)

  You can specify the location of a few optional libraries.  Type
  'sh configure --help=short' for details.


step 2)

  Edit the top of pixmap.c to point to a font that exists on your system.


step 3)

  Type 'make'


step 4)
  
  Copy the binary to wherever you like.  It is dynamically linked, so copying
  it to a different system may or may not work, depending if that system as
  the same libraries configured correctly or not.


If you run into trouble, sent me the details.  I -might- be able to help,
though if you're system is much different than mine I might be just as
lost as you :) :(   - Drew
