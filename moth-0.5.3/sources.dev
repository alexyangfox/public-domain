A source fills each of the columns in a column list with data.

The code for each type of source is in the 'sources' directory.  Each of those
files is included in sources.c and the whole thing is treated as one
compilation unit.  That is perhaps not the most easily extensible approach, but
it should be fairly portable and was pretty easy to implement :)

Each source object manages a column list and a buffer of the source definition.
The buffer needn't be used by all source types (and indeed isn't for
textfiles).
