The parser object reads the contents of a file, processes the XML and creates
the corresponding C data structures.

When a source or image is completed (the closing tag is reached) the data
structure is added to the moth_file object.  (Actions are no longer performed
on the closing tags.)

It uses the expat library for the interpretting the XML.  Many callbacks are
registered with the expat library.  One limitation of the expat library is that
it can only handle one top-level tag per file.  (Hmm... this may be part of the
XML specification.)
