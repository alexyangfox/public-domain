This library presents general data handling functions and objects, as well as
defines types and structures used by many other parts of Moth.



RUNTIME   (struct moth_runtime_s)

  Represents the runtime environment, and is accessible to everyone through the
  global 'runtime'.

  This object is actually created in moth.c.



WARN / DIE

  Error reporting functions, of two different degrees :)



SCALE_VALUE / UNSCALE_VALUE / CONVERT_VALUE / READ_VALUE

  For manipulating doubles.



BUFFERS

  A buffer is a chunk of binary data.  Most frequently, it's used to store
  strings.

  Buffers are implemented in chunks, where each _add() adds a chunk.  Both
  _data() and _strdup() smoosh the chunks down into one single chunk.



COLORS

  A color can be specified with red/green/blue values, or by name.  The named
  colors are defined in rgb.c.  Alpha levels are also supported.

  rgb.c is compiled in as C code since we don't care to keep the named colors
  in any special kind of datastructure -- a list is fine.
