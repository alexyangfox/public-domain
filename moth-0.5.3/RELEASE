release 0.5.3
=============

Just a quick little release to fix an important bug.  Until now, datetime axis
locations (grids and labels and snap-to) where calculated using simple modulus
math, which is to say it didn't take into account leap years, leap seconds,
timezones, etc.  Ouch!  This release fixes that.



release 0.5.2
=============

Well, I have a job now, so here's a release of the features that have been in
CVS for a while but not packaged up into a nice tarball.

features
  * draw <line> continuously, instead of series of line segments
  * draw <area> continuously, instead of series of areas
  * replaced gmtime() with localtime(), since that's easier for folks to read
  * only one of <grid x-modulus y-modulus> required

bugfixes
  * fixed bug when reading rrd files where columns that weren't requested get
    intermixed with the timestamps
  * lazy evaluated values can no longer be COPYed in <rpn>s

cleanups
  * removed unnecessary library header include
  * added a 'break' for each switch default, to silence some compiler warnings
    (Thanks to Ian Holsman.)
  * option "xml-relative" is the default



release 0.5.1
=============

This release is mainly inspired by the fix for bug #753368.  No cool new
features for this release.


bugfixes

  * fixed bug #753368:  can't read exponent values correctly
  * fixed bug where moth would segfault when scaling=auto and a column was
    comprised entirely of NaNs
  * draw last (left- and top-most) grid lines
  * fixed small logic bug in axes.c that only showed up when compiling with -O0


cleanups

  * show ticks for labels even if they don't have any text
  * renamed occurances of "render" to "draw", just for consistancy
  * unified all defaults and some constants (into data.h)
  * replace use of '%lf' with '%g' in *printf, where applicable


refactoring

  * refactor drawing algorithm into phases
  * moved viewporting from pixmap to image
  * removed "draw-nan" option



release 0.5.0
=============

  Continuing with the "even is beta, odd is alpha" release numbering scheme,
  we present to you version 0.5.0 of moth, an alpha release introducing new
  features.

features
  * argument --dump-xml
  * <axis scaling="auto">
  * supports grouping of shortcut arguments
  * argument --version
  * argument --quiet to not show warnings

refactoring
  * separate execution into three stages:  turn XML into data structures,
    execute data sources, and draw images
  * refactored layout algorithm, again, and made it cleaner
  * moved the color store into the image, since each image should really have
    its own set of colors

cleanups
  * reorganized data.c,h slightly
  * fixed bug #670931:  negative signs in right tick values eaten by juxtaposition
  * fixed bug where <moth> attributes were too sticky when using many XML files
  * better default for <points> radius attribute
  * art_vpath_perturb() no longer needed



release 0.4.2
=============

  OK, so I wrote a test framework, and uncovered a bunch (13) bugs.  This
  release fixes for 12 of them.  (The last one is a bit trickier, and will
  await an alpha release.)

  This is only a bugfix release.  No new features have been added.
  
  * fixed bug #670919:  watermark location is wrong when using a large border-size
  * fixed bug #670921:  constant columns in drawing layers should work
  * fixed bug #670924:  can't understand unit 'E' (exa, 1e18)
  * fixed bug #670926:  <rpn> datetime OPs should return NaN for NaN input
  * fixed bug #670928:  <rpn> MONTH and YEAR should have their ranges adjusted
  * fixed bug #670929:  <rpn> logic OPs should consider NaN to be false
  * fixed bug #670930:  <rpn> MOD integer part is wrong
  * fixed bug #670934:  <textfile> reads data wrong at buffer boundary
  * fixed bug #670939:  error message when column is missing isn't very descriptive
  * fixed bug #670940:  watermark is clipped when neither bottom axis nor legend
  * fixed bug #672118:  really long first line of legend too low
  * fixed bug #674426:  the color "gold" is misspelled


release 0.4.1
=============

  * fixed small bug when using the --with-rrd argument of configure


release 0.4
===========

features
  * new configure.in and Makefile.in by Ian Holsman <lists@holsman.net>
  * --draw-nan argument, <moth draw-nan="on"> implemented
  * --no-draw argument, <moth draw="off"> implemented
  * all arguments can be specified as attributes to the <moth> tag
  * <points> swatch drawn filled if applicable
  * <rpn> can create constant columns
  * no need to specify null axes

documentation
  * wrote DTD
  * added .dev file for each major .c file, describing coding approaches
    and issues  (idea borrowed from the perl6 .dev files)

refactoring
  * move axis/column association into moth_axis code
  * layers and sources now use the runtime column store
  * <rpn> tokens are handled as a linked list, with performance benefits
  * rewrote <label> template tokenizer
  * created moth_image_add_layer() and moved image struct out of header
  * refactored columns so that named and constant columns are handled similarly
  * factor out columns into columns.c,h
  * captures runtime environment in a struct
  * changed parser to use new runtime environment
    (implemented with a global [yeach...])
  * swatch drawing code refactored into layers.c,h

cleanups
  * cleaned up and unified axis and tick drawing
  * bunch of code cleanups and clarifications in sources/*.c
  * <rpn> always evaluates at least once
  * all applicable attributes use new unified column type
  * fixed memory leak in <textfile>
  * fixed small memory leak when drawing areas
  * removed unused 'format_size' in axes.c
  * made an ernest attempt to keep line lengths below 80 characters
  * image now uses macro defined by configure for version watermark
    patch provided by Ian Holsman <lists@holsman.net>
  * applied 'break' at end of default clause of switches
  * decommissioned unused function moth_format_add()


release 0.3
===========

  many bugfixes and code cleanup, and a bunch of new features added.

  * now 'sh configure' before 'make'  (which is a good thing)
  * boolean attributes also accept "true"
  * layer attributes that use columns can also use constants
  * <points> attribute "fill" to draw filled
  * more functions for <rpn>
  * numeric layer attributes can also take column names
    (<line width>  <points radius>  <segments width>)
  * four new <image> attributes controlling background and border
  * string width modifier now supported in more cases of <label> templates
  * <area> and <segments> attributes "x0" and "x1" secondarily default to "x"
  * <area> and <segments> attributes "y0" and "y1" secondarily default to "y"

  * fixed bug 598085
  * don't draw <points> with invalid radii
  * fixed a bug where not all units where supported
  * made it so that an axis that only displays one value (min==max)
    auto-adjusts so that the value appears in the center of the axis
  * fixed bug where it would segfault with an empty <label> template

  * refactored how data is pulled out of a column
  * more code cleanup and commenting
  * safety code in calculating <label> ticks if more ticks than pixels
  * optimized memory usage a little


release 0.2
===========

   many features from the TODO list added.  (also thought of some new stuff to
   add to the list.) fixed bugs that I found and knew of, but I could still
   use some help finding more :)


release 0.1
===========

  Initial development release, with foundation functionality.
