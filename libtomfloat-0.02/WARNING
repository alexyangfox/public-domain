LibTomFloat is a *VERY* new package and is not even fully written yet.  Quite a 
bit of the functionality is present but will be changing in the near future to allow
for optimizations (e.g. early-outs).

Please don't use LibTomFloat just yet for any production or fielded system.  

By all means if you wish to test and help find bugs in LibTomFloat give the package a try.

I do not guarantee the numerical accuracy of this package as of yet.

You've been warned.
