v0.02 -- Added missing objects to the makefile [oops]
      -- fixed up mpf_add and mpf_sub to be more reliable about the precision
      -- added required limited ln function mpf_ln_l (domain 0 < x <= 2)
         It's still incomplete as it converges slowly (and therefore yields incorrect results)
      -- Added mpf_ln and mpf_atan
      -- Added short-circuits to sin, cos, invsqrt, atan, ln and sqrt [huge speedup]
      -- Optimized mpf_sqrt and mpf_invsqrt by using quick estimates.  Fixed 
         circular dependency as well (mpf_sqrt requires mpf_invsqrt but not vice versa)
      ++ Note: No further releases are planned for a while.  I encourage interested
         parties to fork this code base and extend it!
