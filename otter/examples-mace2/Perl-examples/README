This directory contains an example of a Perl program that
calls MACE.

File Sheffer-mgi-without-mirrors contains Boolean algebra
identities alpha=x in terms of the Sheffer stroke.  Every such,
identity of length <= 15, or its mirror image, is subsumed by a
member of that file.

The Perl program commute4_filter goes through a file of
equations (one equation per line) and calls MACE for each,
looking for a noncommutative model of size <= 4.  If none
exist, the equation is printed.

The command

   commute4_filter < Sheffer-mgi-without-mirrors > candidates

should produce 25 candidates.

NOTE: You might have to edit commute4_filter to point it at the mace2 binary.
