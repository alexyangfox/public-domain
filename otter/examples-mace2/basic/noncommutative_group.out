--- Starting search for models of size 6 ---

Applying isomorphism constraints to constants: e b a.

16780 clauses were generated; 13181 of those survived the first stage
of unit preprocessing; there are 1602 atoms.

After all unit preprocessing, 1483 atoms are still unassigned;
12987 clauses remain; 41 of those are non-Horn (selectable);
4927 K allocated; cpu time so far for this domain size: 0.01 sec.

The 1st model has been found.

The 10th model has been found.

The search is complete.  The set is satisfiable (18 model(s) found).
