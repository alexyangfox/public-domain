--- Starting search for models of size 4 ---


3216 clauses were generated; 2688 of those survived the first stage
of unit preprocessing; there are 480 atoms.

After all unit preprocessing, 448 atoms are still unassigned;
2656 clauses remain; 16 of those are non-Horn (selectable);
4895 K allocated; cpu time so far for this domain size: 0.00 sec.

The 1st model has been found.

The 10th model has been found.
