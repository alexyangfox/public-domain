--- Starting search for models of size 3 ---

Applying isomorphism constraints to constants: b a.

19894 clauses were generated; 7103 of those survived the first stage
of unit preprocessing; there are 105 atoms.

After all unit preprocessing, 22 atoms are still unassigned;
653 clauses remain; 10 of those are non-Horn (selectable);
4885 K allocated; cpu time so far for this domain size: 0.01 sec.

The 1st model has been found.

The search is complete.  The set is satisfiable (6 model(s) found).
