--- Starting search for models of size 4 ---

Applying isomorphism constraints to constants: L Q.

3244 clauses were generated; 3144 of those survived the first stage
of unit preprocessing; there are 536 atoms.

After all unit preprocessing, 516 atoms are still unassigned;
3124 clauses remain; 22 of those are non-Horn (selectable);
4897 K allocated; cpu time so far for this domain size: 0.00 sec.

The 1st model has been found.

The 10th model has been found.

Exit by max_models parameter.  The set is satisfiable (50 model(s) found).
