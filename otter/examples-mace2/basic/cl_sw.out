--- Starting search for models of size 3 ---

Applying isomorphism constraints to constants: W S $c1.

1095 clauses were generated; 1075 of those survived the first stage
of unit preprocessing; there are 279 atoms.

After all unit preprocessing, 267 atoms are still unassigned;
1063 clauses remain; 13 of those are non-Horn (selectable);
4889 K allocated; cpu time so far for this domain size: 0.00 sec.

The 1st model has been found.

The 10th model has been found.

The search is complete.  The set is satisfiable (20 model(s) found).
