--- Starting search for models of size 4 ---


10612 clauses were generated; 8234 of those survived the first stage
of unit preprocessing; there are 1696 atoms.

After all unit preprocessing, 1605 atoms are still unassigned;
8096 clauses remain; 28 of those are non-Horn (selectable);
4930 K allocated; cpu time so far for this domain size: 0.01 sec.

The 1st model has been found.

The 10th model has been found.
