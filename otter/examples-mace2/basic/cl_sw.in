% A Problem in combinatory logic.
% Given combinators W and s, where
%   Wxy = xyy,
%   Sxyz = xz(yz),
% show that the (weak) fixed point property does not hold,
% that is, that there is a combinator f without a fixed point.
% F combinator f has a fixed point if for all y, fy=y.

formula_list(usable).

all x y (a(a(W,x),y) = a(a(x,y),y)).
all x y z (a(a(a(S,x),y),z) = a(a(x,z),a(y,z))).

% There exsists an element without a fixed point:

-(all f exists y (a(f,y)=y)).
