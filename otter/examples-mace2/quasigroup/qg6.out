--- Starting search for models of size 11 ---

Adding basic QG constraints on last column of f.
function f quasigroup.

35146 clauses were generated; 23686 of those survived the first stage
of unit preprocessing; there are 1452 atoms.

After all unit preprocessing, 871 atoms are still unassigned;
17055 clauses remain; 318 of those are non-Horn (selectable);
4924 K allocated; cpu time so far for this domain size: 0.02 sec.
