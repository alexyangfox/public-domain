--- Starting search for models of size 7 ---

Adding basic QG constraints on last column of f.
function f quasigroup.

36919 clauses were generated; 12677 of those survived the first stage
of unit preprocessing; there are 2793 atoms.

After all unit preprocessing, 2563 atoms are still unassigned;
9787 clauses remain; 120 of those are non-Horn (selectable);
4961 K allocated; cpu time so far for this domain size: 0.02 sec.

The 1st model has been found.

The 10th model has been found.

The search is complete.  The set is satisfiable (14 model(s) found).
