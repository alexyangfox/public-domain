--- Starting search for models of size 8 ---

Adding basic QG constraints on last column of f.
function f quasigroup.

9757 clauses were generated; 5744 of those survived the first stage
of unit preprocessing; there are 576 atoms.

After all unit preprocessing, 298 atoms are still unassigned;
3830 clauses remain; 162 of those are non-Horn (selectable);
4898 K allocated; cpu time so far for this domain size: 0.01 sec.
