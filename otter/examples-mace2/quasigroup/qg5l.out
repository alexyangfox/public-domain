--- Starting search for models of size 11 ---

Adding basic QG constraints on last column of f.
function f quasigroup.

64428 clauses were generated; 40098 of those survived the first stage
of unit preprocessing; there are 1452 atoms.

After all unit preprocessing, 824 atoms are still unassigned;
28488 clauses remain; 312 of those are non-Horn (selectable);
4924 K allocated; cpu time so far for this domain size: 0.04 sec.

The 1st model has been found.

The search is complete.  The set is satisfiable (5 model(s) found).
