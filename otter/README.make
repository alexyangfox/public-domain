If you are on recent Linux or Macintosh operating system,
Running "make all" from the main directory might be all that
is necessary.  If it succeeds, binaries for {otter,mace2,anldp}
will appear in the directory bin/.

The Otter source is in the directory source/; the Mace2 source
is in the directory mace2/.  See Makefiles in those directories
for hints if you have trouble compiling.
