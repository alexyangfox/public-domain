OTTER HIGHLIGHTS
----------------

Over the years we've added many experimental features to Otter,
but the basic functions haven't changed much in the past
ten years.

The Otter package now includes Mace 2 (as a separate program).

----------------
Mace2 HIGHLIGHTS
----------------

Mace2 is now in independent program.  It no longer calls Otter
to parse the input.  It still accepts the same inputs as Otter.
Performance is sometimes better than in previous versions
(see mace2/README.22).

----------------
DOCUMENTS
----------------

The documents directory contains a (newly updated) Otter 3.3
manual and a Mace 2.0 manual.  See documents/README.

----------------
FETCHING
----------------

Download Otter 3.3 and Mace 2.2 from the Otter Web page:

  http://www.mcs.anl.gov/AR/otter/

----------------
INSTALLING AND TESTING (for unix-like systems)
----------------

Unpack the package with a command something like

  % gunzip -c otter-3.3.tar.gz | tar xvf -

Then

  % cd otter-3.3

If you are on a recent linux or Macintosh system, try

  % make install      (this just copies pre-compiled binaries to ./bin/)
  % make test-otter
  % make test-mace2

Macintosh users:  If you see "make: Command not found.", it means
you don't have the developer's tools (compliers, etc.) installed.
The good news is that you don't need them.  Instead, run the commands
"./make-install", "./make-test-otter", and "./make-test-mace2".

If test-otter gives a proof and test-mace2 gives a model, everything is
probably okay.  The binaries should be in the directory bin/.

If something goes wrong, try

  % make all

THEN

  % make test-otter
  % make test-mace2

If any of that fails, see README.make.

To run the Otter test suite, "cd examples; ./Run_all".
To run the Mace2 test suite, "cd examples-mace; ./Run_all".
