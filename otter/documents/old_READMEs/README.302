                     Otter, Version 3.0.2
                     --------------------

Summary of changes from 3.0.0.  See Changelog for details.

1. Several bugs related to answer literals have been fixed.

2. Forward subsumption on nonunits has been made a bit faster.

3. FormEd string parsing has been fixed.

4. Otter can output its input clauses in a form suitable for ANL-DP,
   a program that searches for small models.  If the flag dp_transform
   is set, Otter will translate the input clauses then exit without
   searching for a proof.  See the report anl-dp, which can be FTPed
   from info.mcs.anl.gov in pub/Otter/papers.  ANL-DP will be distributed
   later.

5. Otter can output proofs in a very detailed form with
   set(build_proof_object).  This produces a proof object (an s-expression)
   containing all the substitutions and positions for the inferences
   so that a very simple independent program can check the proofs
   (without having to know about unification or matching).  E-mail
   mccune@mcs.anl.gov for more information.

6. Otter prints its ordinary proofs in a bit more detail than before.
   (As a result, Sec. 15, "Output and Exit Codes", of the manual is
    out of date.)

FTP Otter 3.0.2 from info.mcs.anl.gov in pub/Otter/otter-3.0.2.tar.Z .

See pub/Otter/README for information on DOS (3.0.1) and Mac (3.0.0) versions.
