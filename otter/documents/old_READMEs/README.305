                     Otter, Version 3.0.5
                     --------------------

It has been more than two years since the release of Otter 3.0.4.  I
haven't done a lot of work on Otter since then, but there have been a
few small bug fixes, and a few new features.  See document/New_305.txt
for a summary and Changelog for more complete details.

If you're happy with version 3.0.4, there shouldn't be any hurry to
upgrade to 3.0.5.
