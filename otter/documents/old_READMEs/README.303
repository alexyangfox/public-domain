                     Otter, Version 3.0.3
                     --------------------

Summary of changes from 3.0.2.

1. Several bugs have been fixed (see Changelog).
   (One known bug has not fixed: Do not use lex-dependent demodulation with
   build_proof_object.)

2. Two new features:

   A new parameter, max_answers, allows the user to limit the number
   of answer literal in a clause.  For example, assign(max_answers, 3).

   Weighting has been extended to allow the user to specify terms that
   _contain_ particular terms.  This is done with a new unary function
   symbol $dots(_).  If $dots(t) occurs in a weight template, it will
   match any term that contains a term that matches t.  This is very
   useful for discarding "bad" clauses.
   Here is part of an output file that illustrates $dots.

3. An ASCII version of the manual is included.
