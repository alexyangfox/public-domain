Mace 2.2

NEW FEATURE

An optimization has been added.  See the "August 4-6, 2003" entry
in the Changelog file.

COMPILING

The code is linked with the the library ../source/libotter.a,
which is created when Otter is compiled, so you have to
compile Otter first.

Compiling Mace2 from the parent directory (make all) puts the
binaries in ../bin/.

If you 'make mace2' here, the binary stays here.
