The subdirectories contain some example input files for Otter 3.0.x
Most of them run within a few seconds and require little memory.

   auto - examples (mostly from earlier releases) that run in Otter's
          autonomous mode.

   misc - other examples (mostly from earlier releases).

   kalman - some examples contributed by John Kalman (kalman@mat.aukuni.ac.nz).

   program - some examples of "programming" otter.
         WARNING: two_inv.in takes a few minutes.

   wos - some examples contributed by Larry Wos (wos@mcs.anl.gov)

   fringe - examples demonstrating some of the esoteric features.

   split - examples demonstrating the new splitting rule in 3.0.5.

   ivy - examples as used by the Ivy system (new in 3.0.6).

The C shell script Run_group will run all of the examples in a
subdirectory and compare the results to the results on my computer.
Run it, for example, like this (a few seconds)

   Run_group kalman

Also, you can run all of the examples like this (a few minutes)

   Run_all

Of course, you can also run the examples individually, for example

   cd program
   ../../source/otter < two_inv.in > two_inv.out &
