__________________________________________________________________________

   Note that some ftp sites may not yet have the latest versions of
   Zip and UnZip when you read this.  The latest versions, including
   the crypt sources, are always in ftp.uu.net:/pub/archiving/zip/...

   SITE OWNERS:  If you're listed in here but the information is not
   correct (or if you're a big or overseas site but aren't listed at
   all), please let us know!  E-mail to zip-bugs at the address given
   in README and we'll update this file.

ftp sites for the US-exportable sources and executables:

   NOTE:  Look for the file names given above in the following
   directories.  Some sites like to use slightly different names,
   such as zip-2.0.1.tar-z instead of zip201.tar.Z, or MacUnZip-5.1.hqx
   instead of mac-unzip-51.hqx.  In the case of some comp.sources.misc
   archive sites, directories may be used (zip201/part01.Z ... part11.Z,
   zip201/patch01.Z, etc.).

   ftp.uu.net:/pub/archiving/zip/...    [THIS MIRRORS THE INFO-ZIP HOME SITE]

   oak.oakland.edu:/pub/misc/unix/...
   oak.oakland.edu:/pub/misc/vaxvms/...
   oak.oakland.edu:/pub/msdos/zip/...
   oak.oakland.edu:/pub/msdos/windows3/...

ftp sites for the encryption and decryption sources and/or executables:

   NOTE 1:  Non-US users, please do NOT ftp from the US sites (US
   regulations and all that).  Likewise, US users, please do not
   ftp from the European sites (it's not illegal, but it sure is
   a waste of expensive bandwidth).

   NOTE 2:  Some sites may carry both encryption and non-encryption
   executables with slightly different names; for example, zip201c2.zip
   instead of zip201x2.zip ("c" == crypt version).  Other sites may
   include *only* the encryption-related executables (zip and zipcloak)
   in a second archive (e.g., zcryp20x.zip).

   From the US:
      wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors/garbo.uwasa.fi/arcutil/zcrypt21.zip
      ftp.uu.net:/pub/archiving/zip/zcrypt21.zip

   Outside the US:
      garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/arcutil/zcrypt21.zip
      ftp.inria.fr:/system/arch-compr/zcrypt21.zip
      ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de:/pub/comp/os/os2/archiver/zcrypt21.zip
         (mail server at ftp-mailer@informatik.tu-muenchen.de)

      ftp.win.tue.nl:/pub/compression/zip/...
      ftp.uni-erlangen.de:/pub/pc/msdos/utilities/zip/...

ftp sites for VMS-format Zip/UnZip package (sources and executables, no
encryption/decryption--see also "Mail servers" section below):

      ftp.uu.net:/pub/archiving/zip/VMS/*

   The ZIP-UNZIP package for VMS is available via anonymous ftp from
   ftp.spc.edu [192.107.46.27]; the following files are needed:

   [.MACRO32]AAAREADME.TXT
   [.MACRO32]LZDCMP.EXE
   [.MACRO32.SAVESETS]ZIP-UNZIP.BCK_Z

   VMS sources and object files are also available from vmsnet.sources
   archives (e.g., black.cerritos.edu:[.mailserv.zip_unzip]*.*).

To find other ftp sites:

   The "archie" ftp database utility can be used to find an ftp site
   near you.  If you don't know how to use it, DON'T ASK US--check the
   Usenet groups news.newusers.questions or news.answers or some such,
   or ask your system administrator (or just RTFM :-) ).

UUCP sites:

   uunet!~/pub/archiving/zip/ ...

         Win 3.x, NT, OS/2 2.x)

Mail servers:

   If you don't have anonymous FTP capability, you can mail one
   of the following commands (in the body of an e-mail message) to
   listserv@vm.ecs.rpi.edu or listserv@vm1.nodak.edu in order to
   get a copy via e-mail:

      /pdget mail /pub/misc/unix/unzip51.tar.Z uuencode
      /pdget mail /pub/misc/unix/zip201.zip uuencode

   The older, pseudo-TOPS-20 style also works:

      /pdget mail pd:<misc.unix>unzip51.tar.Z uuencode
      /pdget mail pd:<misc.unix>zip201.zip uuencode

   [NOTE:  As of 28 Jan 94, the NoDak server still had a minor bug in
   its code which prevented it from finding files with more than one
   dot in their names.  The RPI server had just fixed this bug, and in
   all likelihood the NoDak server will be fixed before you read this.]

   To get the encryption source by e-mail, send the following commands
   to ftp-mailer@informatik.tu-muenchen.de:

      get /pub/utils/archiver/zcrypt21.zip
      quit

   To get the VMS Zip/UnZip package by e-mail, send the following
   commands in the body of a mail message to mxserver@wkuvx1.wku.edu
   (the "HELP" command is also accepted):

      SEND ZIP-UNZIP
      SEND FILESERV_TOOLS
