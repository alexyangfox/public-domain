;;; HOW THE STREAM STRUCTURE IS USED:
;;;
;;;    Many of the slots of the stream structure contain functions
;;; which are called to perform some operation on the stream.  Closed
;;; streams have #'Closed-Flame in all of their function slots.  If
;;; one side of an I/O or echo stream is closed, the whole stream is
;;; considered closed.  The functions in the operation slots take
;;; arguments as follows:
;;;
;;; In:			Stream, Eof-Errorp, Eof-Value
;;; Bin:		Stream, Eof-Errorp, Eof-Value
;;; N-Bin:		Stream, Buffer, Start, Numbytes, Eof-Errorp
;;; Out:		Stream, Character
;;; Bout:		Stream, Integer
;;; Sout:		Stream, String, Start, End
;;; Misc:		Stream, Operation, &Optional Arg1, Arg2
;;;
;;;    In order to save space, some of the less common stream operations
;;; are handled by just one function, the Misc method.  This function
;;; is passed a keyword which indicates the operation to perform.
;;; The following keywords are used:
;;;  :listen 		- Return the following values:
;;; 			     t if any input waiting.
;;; 			     :eof if at eof.
;;; 			     nil if no input is available and not at eof.
;;;  :unread		- Unread the character Arg.
;;;  :close		- Do any stream specific stuff to close the stream.
;;;			  The methods are set to closed-flame by the close
;;;			  function, so that need not be done by this
;;;			  function.
;;;  :clear-input 	- Clear any unread input
;;;  :finish-output,
;;;  :force-output	- Cause output to happen
;;;  :clear-output	- Clear any undone output
;;;  :element-type 	- Return the type of element the stream deals wit<h.
;;;  :line-length	- Return the length of a line of output.
;;;  :charpos		- Return current output position on the line.
;;;  :file-length	- Return the file length of a file stream.
;;;  :file-position	- Return or change the current position of a file stream.
;;;  :file-name		- Return the name of an associated file.
;;;  :interactive-p     - Is this an interactive device?
;;;
;;;    In order to do almost anything useful, it is necessary to
;;; define a new type of structure that includes stream, so that the
;;; stream can have some state information.
;;;
;;; THE STREAM IN-BUFFER:
;;;
;;;    The In-Buffer in the stream holds characters or bytes that
;;; are ready to be read by some input function.  If there is any
;;; stuff in the In-Buffer, then the reading function can use it
;;; without calling any stream method.  Any stream may put stuff in
;;; the In-Buffer, and may also assume that any input in the In-Buffer
;;; has been consumed before any in-method is called.  If a text
;;; stream has in In-Buffer, then the first character should not be
;;; used to buffer normal input so that it is free for unreading into.
;;;
;;;    The In-Buffer slot is a vector In-Buffer-Length long.  The
;;; In-Index is the index in the In-Buffer of the first available
;;; object.  The available objects are thus between In-Index and the
;;; length of the In-Buffer.
;;;
;;;    When this buffer is only accessed by the normal stream
;;; functions, the number of function calls is halved, thus
;;; potentially doubling the speed of simple operations.  If the
;;; Fast-Read-Char and Fast-Read-Byte macros are used, nearly all
;;; function call overhead is removed, vastly speeding up these
;;; important operations.
;;;
;;;    If a stream does not have an In-Buffer, then the In-Buffer slot
;;; must be nil, and the In-Index must be In-Buffer-Length.  These are
;;; the default values for the slots.
