BASIC COMMON LISP SUPPORT CODE:

Enhancements:
 -- Allow pretty-printer to work without compiler loaded.
 -- Improved (and thus changed) the SXHASH of lists and other composite
    objects.
 -- Added to *FEATURES* all of the ANSI CL features that seemed plausible.
    Any non-ANSI compliance is now a bug, not a feature...
 -- Picked up Miles' changes to apropos and apropos-list that allows one to
    supply NIL for the package, meaning all packages.

Bug fixes:
 -- Fix arg ordering for GETF in new condition support.  Default the name
    slot in DEFMACRO-LAMBDA-LIST-BIND-ERRORS to NIL (instead of leaving it
    unbound.)
 -- In READ-N-BYTES, only signal EOF when we read and got 0 bytes, not never
    read returns less than we wanted.  Also, fix the case of small reads with
    an empty buffer not to leave garbled buffer pointers if we have to do more
    than one read.  These bugs mostly affect the X interface and its users
    (Garnet was having problems.)
 -- Changed YES-OR-NO-P and Y-OR-N-P to force output.
 -- Fixed COUNT :TEST-NOT to actually negate the test.
 -- Fixed COERCE to call type-expand so that people can coerce to deftypes.
 -- Rename STEP to DEBUG::SET-STEP-BREAKPOINT because step is supposed to be
    the exported step macro, not some internal routine.
 -- Fixed DEFPACKAGE to combine multiple use, export, and import options
    correctly.  Fixed the warning about no longer using some packages to
    actually work.
 -- Fixed GCD to correctly handle MOST-NEGATIVE-FIXNUM.
 -- Flush Hemlock font change hack in default site-init.lisp, since it was
    causing problems.

CLOS (PCL):
 -- Add some hacks for coercing lisp:class objects to pcl:class.
 -- Export MAKE-LOAD-FORM-SAVING-SLOTS, not MAKE-LOAD-FORM-DUMPING-SLOTS.
 -- Fix some problems with the LISP:CLASS class-precedence-list suddenly
    becoming empty when a class is redefined.
 -- Fixed SIMPLE-STRING to list STRING in the inherits list.
 -- Changed the byte-function and byte-closure funcallable-instances to use
    &more args instead of a &rest arg (eliminating the main source of
    grautitous consing in byte code.)
 -- When building a release, the :RUNTIME feature suppresss loading the
    compiled and loads other subsystems byte compiled.  See README file,
    "Runtime distribution" section.


COMPILER:

Enhancements:
 -- Added a type inference method for LOG's result type.
 -- Added support for "more args" which are like rest args, but don't cons.
    This is used for calling into annd out of byte-compiled core and in the
    PROFILE package.
 -- Increase *inline-expansion-limit* from 50 to 200.  Change "inline
    expansion count exceeded" warning to be a note.  Don't inline expand in
    interpreted code.

Bug fixes:
 -- Fix a problem where spurious argument types could be inferred for optional
    arguments in byte-compiled code (caused yes-or-no-p to fail.)
 -- Fixed an internal error related to tail local calls.
 -- Fixed assertion failure about COMPONENT-NEW-FUNCTIONS with some inline
    expansions. 
 -- Fixed (TYPEP X '(REAL ...)) to actually test against REAL, not NUMBER.
 -- Fixed a problem where top-level MULTIPLE-VALUE-CALL forms could cause an
    assertion falure. 
 -- Don't try to compile flow-graph components that are unreachable.  This
    avoids some internal errors when unreachable local functions are
    deleted.
 -- Fix problem with byte-compiling PROGV getting an internal compiler error.


EXTENSIONS:

Misc extensions:
 -- Added an executable-only optional to EXT:UNIX-NAMESTRING so that we can
    expand path:foo into the first executable in the path named foo, not just
    the first file
 -- Changed RUN-PROGRAM to only try to run executables, and to flame out if it
    can't be found in path:.
 -- Profile: use &more instead of &rest to avoid consing the &rest arg list.
    Fixed PROFILE:REPORT-TIME to not choke if any of the function names are
    not symbols (e.g. setf functions).

Motif interface:
 -- Added an optional STYLE arg to the graphical inspector to make the
    function consistent with its doc string (as well as the old inspector).
 -- Tried to make starting the Motif server more robust, or at least give some
    intelligible error message.
 -- Added some extra protection against recursive invocation of the windowing
    debugger.

Hemlock:
 -- Add window-buffer-hook for echo area buffer to make absolutely sure we
    can't change the eacho area window to point to another buffer.
 -- Give a sensible error message if we can't find the slave utility (e.g.
    lisp) to run.
 -- Restored the behavior of scribe-file to cd to the directory of the .mss
    file before running scribe.
 -- Change default fonts to be courier, flushing all mention of 8x13.
    Remove font-setting in default site-init file, since it was causing
    problems.
