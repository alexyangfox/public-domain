To build and install:

1.) Determine the correct Makefile for your system; Makefile and
config.mk are for GNU make; Makefile.bsd and config.mk.bsd should work
with BSD make.

2.) Edit config.mk or config.mk.bsd as needed.  Pay attention to the
CONFIG_* options at the top in particular, which control compiled-in
defaults.

3.) make clean

4.) make CC="gcc" CFLAGS="<options>"

5.) (optionally) make strip

6.) make PREFIX=<path> install

The install target also respects DESTDIR.  You can prepare a source
tarball for distribution using the dist target.
